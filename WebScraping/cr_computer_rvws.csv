After the 7th repair, replacing cables, motherboard, hard drive, RAM, etc, I finally called Apple and they gave us a new one. I give 2 stars because they replaced it and the second Pro is still working without fail.

Apparently Best Buy will service what you buy for a year. In any event, the touch pad is maddening, the keys often don't work, and in some ways it is actually slower than my 6 year old software glutted Acer 1430z with Windows 7 (which was half the price). Also Windows 10 is not as intuitive as 7 and doesn't seem to work as well with my Home Group. As a PC user since 1988 I was reluctant to go to a Mac.

The touch screen and tablet feature is a great transition always with the dedicated keyboard available. I have to admit, it's odd folding the keyboard 360 degrees backwards for tablet setup and placing the computer down in essence on top of the keys. It turns off so you won't type, but I could see you getting things into the keys if you're not careful. I like the ""tent"" setup where you fold the keyboard back so it looks like a tent. It goes into tablet mode but lets you watch video without having to hold it like traditional tablets. It is a bit slow with the Pentium processor and the physical platen hard drive (not solid state) but all of this is why it's a a very reasonable price. It's still 500 MB of hard drive. Things to consider on these new 2-in-1 machines 1. Most have gotten rid of the CD/DVD drive, this is the case here. I don't miss it 2. Many don't have card readers, this one does which I really like 3. Most have gone down to 1 USB port. This has 3, 1x USB 2.0 and 2x USB 3.0. This was a big reason I liked this computer 4. Most have relatively inaccessible batteries which is the case here 5. Most have limited external monitor ports. Most have only 1 and it's usually HDMI. The most recent are mini-HDMI which means all new cables. This has a standard HDMI which was a big reason I bought this one. Diplay Port (Dell) and mini-Display Port (Apple) are the others.","Yes, I would recommend to a friend",http://www.consumerreports.org/products/laptop/hp-pavilion-m1-u001dx-386340/user-reviews#user-reviews,Verified Buyer Not Found: : <class 'selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException'>/nVerified Reviewer Not Found: : <class 'selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException'>/n

The speakers are not effective enough for online meetings and I had to use bluetooth. Win 10 made this impossible to manage- each time I had to go deep into settings and reconnect as there is no short cut. Several times I would need to reset speakers completely in order to change speakers. This was an OS issue however if the speakers were effective I wouldn't have had to use other options. Screen went all the way to the edge- I realize now that added to the screen clarity and I miss that. I have Windows 10 on my new laptop and don't have the same problems- Surface Book was always requiring updates and critical error repairs and so far I have not had any of the Win 10 issues that I had continually on the Book. Win Hello works reliably on my new lap top: it did not on Book and the camera would frequently stop working. It also ran out of memory all the time- I was unable to save anything to the pc and carried a portable external hard drive to save everything to.

As far as laptops go, it's a solid performer. I love that it's a true hybrid of a notebook and laptop. Yes, occasionally it will freeze when reactivating from a lid close, but it's only been twice in five months for me. Every laptop I've had in 15 years has had an occasional glitch--even my last one, which was a Mac. Going from Mac to the Surface was easier than I thought. The track pad gestures are similar, but Apple still holds the edge. However, the Surface's touchscreen display is a huge bonus. I use that more than I thought I would. Plus, the processing power of this machine is far superior to the Mac laptop I had. Finally, this is the only laptop I ever had where I *never* worry about finding an outlet by early-afternoon. It can literally go all day on a single charge with moderate to heavy use. Features I really love about it: large screen size, nice keyboard, touchscreen, lightweight, amazingly long battery life and I can truly work with it on my lap without the keyboard getting hot. I also appreciate that the power cord also has a USB slot to charge my cellphone at the same time. The only features I really wish it had -- native HDMI port.

It is so much more convenient, and faster, than my desktop that it has unexpectedly become my primary computer. While I wish that the batter life were longer, for my purposes it is good enough. (I have the most battery-intensive, and fastest processor currently available on the SP4, an i7.) Most of the time, I can use it plugged in anyway. And the power management seems pretty sophisticated and configurable. I am particularly astounded by the speed with which it operates, thanks in large part to the dependable solid state drive. Also, the USB ports make the occasional use of my small and light external drive a snap. Contrary to the Consumer Reports review, this computer DOES have facial recognition, which is a pleasant alternative to logging in with a password. Whether I am in an airplane, traveling, using the SP4 at a hotel or at home, I am continually delighted by it. After almost one year of use, it still meets all of my needs with ease and grace.

I used the computer to mainly write documents, prepare presentations and use the internet. It has worked fantastically well. I loved the instantaneous start-up time, the good battery life and the general reliability. I've never had any bugs or weird problems. That's why it's so weird that it suddenly died today. I wrote an assignment last night, emailed it to my professor and went to bed. Then, when I wanted to check the weather today, I opened it up and tried to turn it on. No response. I pressed the power button again and again. No response. I plugged it in and let it charge for a few minutes. Still no effect. I looked online via someone else's computer and it looks like a ton of people have run into this problem as well. I tried a number of different ""magic"" button-pressing combinations people attest to online to no avail. I went to the Apple store a few hours ago and the guy there said it's probably due to a logic board failure. That was interesting since many of the people online discussing the same symptoms also noted issues with the logic board. The apple guy was really helpful, at least as much as he could be considering the situation. Replacing the logic board would cost more than half of the original price of the computer, so it looks most reasonable to just get a new computer. But this sucks!!! I would rather have a computer that's a little buggy every once in a while but lasts 4-5 years than one that runs great for just a couple years and then suddenly gives up the technological ghost. The apple guy said he had seen the exact same symptoms before with a malfunctioning logic board and told me I probably did nothing wrong for this to happen, it was just bad luck. It's useful that Consumer Reports provides data on brand reliability. I noticed that while Apple is relatively the best, there is still a frequency of 17% for problematic hardware. I guess I'm just a lucky guy. Would I recommend it? Yes, but I wish you better luck than I had.","Yes, I would recommend to a friend",http://www.consumerreports.org/products/laptop/apple-macbook-air-11-inch-mjvm2ll-a-374085/user-reviews#user-reviews,Verified Buyer Not Found: : <class 'selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException'>/n

It's zippy and plenty powerful for my needs (Photoshop, mostly), and the display is gorgeous. The sound is surprisingly good as well. I got the most storage possible because of all the photography I do. I much prefer the Pro's keyboard to that of the 12"" MacBook (which I use for travel), but I'm underwhelmed with the Pro's battery life; that's its main drawback. At full brightness and only slight Photoshop use, I'll burn through a full charge in around 4 hours just surfing Safari and editing in Word. I have no idea how Consumer Reports gets its massive 17-hour-plus battery results. Like the MacBook, this MacBook Pro also has only USB-C ports, but I'm finding that less of an issue now that many peripherals are coming with USB-C connectors. I like the fact that it has four ports instead of the paltry single port on the 12"" MacBook. I'm surprised how much I like using touch-ID for signing in and the touchbar itself for certain tasks, like archiving or deleting email. I hope the touch-ID can be better integrated online in the future, eradicating the need for entering passwords everywhere.

It has more than met my expectations in most regards. Every aspect of this machine displays quality manufacture, good ergonomics and computing power. This Win10 machine should be useful and contemporary for years. Display: clear, bright, and useful in a wide variety of lighting situations. The screen is not a matte finish and is reflective, so it will show lights and objects in reflections. This has not been a problem, although on airplanes I sometimes have to angle the computer ti reduce reflection from bright objects in a darkened cabin. Resolution of the display is excellent and provides crisp viewing of documents and images. The screen easily displays every fingerprint, and the exterior of the computer tends to show prints as well, but there is an enclosed microfiber cloth which does a nice job of cleaning it up. I've seen reviews which criticize this fingerprint display, but screens generally show fingerprints anyway. Not a big problem for me. Keypad: the touch of the keys is very nice. I can always tell when I have depressed a key. I am able to type fairly fast with no higher error rate than normal. The home/end/pageup/pagedown functions can only be accessed by using the Function key, but that's not unusual with compact laptops; they can only have so many keys. I've become used to using the Function key in combinations as needed. Touchpad: very sensitive. It takes a bit of getting used to, but that's normal whenever you move between machines. The click functions of the main pad and the left/right buttons are easy to control. Speed: this is a very fast machine. Boot-up is less than 30 seconds and it's very responsive. Programs open quickly and operation has been absolutely flawless. TOP marks in this regard, which is one of the most important considerations for me. RAM and hard drive: The 16 GB of RAM and i7 processor make this a very fast machine. I'm confident that I won't run out of storage with the solid state 512 GB hard drive. Ports: It was important to me to have at least two USB-A ports, and I got them. There is also a USB-C port, which is a direction the PC industry is going, so I'm happy to have it. There is also a full size HDMI port which is important because in my higher education environment most projectors and classrooms have full size HDMI connections. There is an SD card port but I typically don't transfer files via SD so I haven't used it. Fingerprint sensor: worked the first half-dozen times I used it, but seems to have decided that's enough. I could try clearing it and re-entering my fingerprint every week, but why bother? I have a 4-character password to access the machine and that's quick and easy. In this regard the fingerprint sensor is no better or worse than most. Touchscreen: The main limitation of the computer is that the touchscreen is designed to open and close programs, drag objects around and carry out similar tasks. It does not serve as a graphics tablet, because its resolution of drawn objects and characters is blocky and rough. It will recognize styli such as the Gosin Digital Stylus, but numbers and characters drawn are blocky. It's not a replacement for a graphics tablet. Weight: it's actually an ounce or two heavier than the 2.8 pounds in its specifications, but it's still the best combination of power, portability and display quality that I have found. It's very compact, fits into a briefcase or backpack, and with the solid state hard drive, it's going to resist travel and handling very well. The folding screen: I like the folding screen which makes the computer into a tablet-like display. Just keep in mind that drawing on the screen isn't likely to result in very well drawn characters. Also be careful if you fold the screen over and sit the computer with the inactive keyboard sitting on an airline fold-down tray; I did this and one of the keys caught on the tray and popped off. ASUS replaced the key under warranty, but since I had to ship it to them (and got it back within 10 days, superb turnaround time) for the replacement, that was an inconvenience. I suspect this caution would apply to most laptops.
