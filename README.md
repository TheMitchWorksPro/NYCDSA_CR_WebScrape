A Blog post link that can tie all of this content together is coming soon ...  The outline below will be completed soon as well ...

## Guide To The Code Within This Project
### Web Scraping Code for Consumer Reports Site

Run the code in this order:

### Data Munging and Analysis Files

There is a little data munging in a few of the final analysis files but overall, the process is separated out.  To prepare
and preprocess the data, run the output files of the screen scraping process through these code files in this order:

1. xx
2. xx
3. xx

#### Final Analysis Code

This is a list ofthe files that actually contain the analysis that was the goal of this project.  Not as much was done
as I would have liked to.  Time was a factor.  But hopefully, you may find some of this interesting or useful.  :-)
