The touch screen and tablet feature is a great transition always with the dedicated keyboard available. I have to admit, it's odd folding the keyboard 360 degrees backwards for tablet setup and placing the computer down in essence on top of the keys. It turns off so you won't type, but I could see you getting things into the keys if you're not careful. I like the ""tent"" setup where you fold the keyboard back so it looks like a tent. It goes into tablet mode but lets you watch video without having to hold it like traditional tablets. It is a bit slow with the Pentium processor and the physical platen hard drive (not solid state) but all of this is why it's a a very reasonable price. It's still 500 MB of hard drive. Things to consider on these new 2-in-1 machines 1. Most have gotten rid of the CD/DVD drive, this is the case here. I don't miss it 2. Many don't have card readers, this one does which I really like 3. Most have gone down to 1 USB port. This has 3, 1x USB 2.0 and 2x USB 3.0. This was a big reason I liked this computer 4. Most have relatively inaccessible batteries which is the case here 5. Most have limited external monitor ports. Most have only 1 and it's usually HDMI. The most recent are mini-HDMI which means all new cables. This has a standard HDMI which was a big reason I bought this one.

I miss the screen clarity- its like going back to SD after having HD- but I love that when I have an online meeting I know that I won't have to apologize for delays due random restarts/screen failures/keyboard glitches. The speakers are not effective enough for online meetings and I had to use bluetooth. Win 10 made this impossible to manage- each time I had to go deep into settings and reconnect as there is no short cut. Several times I would need to reset speakers completely in order to change speakers. This was an OS issue however if the speakers were effective I wouldn't have had to use other options. Screen went all the way to the edge- I realize now that added to the screen clarity and I miss that. I have Windows 10 on my new laptop and don't have the same problems- Surface Book was always requiring updates and critical error repairs and so far I have not had any of the Win 10 issues that I had continually on the Book. Win Hello works reliably on my new lap top: it did not on Book and the camera would frequently stop working. It also ran out of memory all the time- I was unable to save anything to the pc and carried a portable external hard drive to save everything to.

As far as laptops go, it's a solid performer. I love that it's a true hybrid of a notebook and laptop. Yes, occasionally it will freeze when reactivating from a lid close, but it's only been twice in five months for me. Every laptop I've had in 15 years has had an occasional glitch--even my last one, which was a Mac. Going from Mac to the Surface was easier than I thought. The track pad gestures are similar, but Apple still holds the edge. However, the Surface's touchscreen display is a huge bonus. I use that more than I thought I would. Plus, the processing power of this machine is far superior to the Mac laptop I had. Finally, this is the only laptop I ever had where I *never* worry about finding an outlet by early-afternoon. It can literally go all day on a single charge with moderate to heavy use. Features I really love about it: large screen size, nice keyboard, touchscreen, lightweight, amazingly long battery life and I can truly work with it on my lap without the keyboard getting hot.

I used the computer to mainly write documents, prepare presentations and use the internet. It has worked fantastically well. I loved the instantaneous start-up time, the good battery life and the general reliability. I've never had any bugs or weird problems. That's why it's so weird that it suddenly died today. I wrote an assignment last night, emailed it to my professor and went to bed. Then, when I wanted to check the weather today, I opened it up and tried to turn it on. No response. I pressed the power button again and again. No response. I plugged it in and let it charge for a few minutes. Still no effect. I looked online via someone else's computer and it looks like a ton of people have run into this problem as well. I tried a number of different ""magic"" button-pressing combinations people attest to online to no avail. I went to the Apple store a few hours ago and the guy there said it's probably due to a logic board failure. That was interesting since many of the people online discussing the same symptoms also noted issues with the logic board. The apple guy was really helpful, at least as much as he could be considering the situation. Replacing the logic board would cost more than half of the original price of the computer, so it looks most reasonable to just get a new computer. But this sucks!!! I would rather have a computer that's a little buggy every once in a while but lasts 4-5 years than one that runs great for just a couple years and then suddenly gives up the technological ghost. The apple guy said he had seen the exact same symptoms before with a malfunctioning logic board and told me I probably did nothing wrong for this to happen, it was just bad luck. It's useful that Consumer Reports provides data on brand reliability. I noticed that while Apple is relatively the best, there is still a frequency of 17% for problematic hardware. I guess I'm just a lucky guy. Would I recommend it? Yes, but I wish you better luck than I had.","Yes, I would recommend to a friend","http://www.consumerreports.org/products/laptop/apple-macbook-air-11-inch-mjvm2ll-a-374085/user-reviews#user-reviews","Verified Buyer Not Found: : <class 'selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException'>/n",1

It's zippy and plenty powerful for my needs (Photoshop, mostly), and the display is gorgeous. The sound is surprisingly good as well. I got the most storage possible because of all the photography I do. I much prefer the Pro's keyboard to that of the 12"" MacBook (which I use for travel), but I'm underwhelmed with the Pro's battery life; that's its main drawback. At full brightness and only slight Photoshop use, I'll burn through a full charge in around 4 hours just surfing Safari and editing in Word. I have no idea how Consumer Reports gets its massive 17-hour-plus battery results. Like the MacBook, this MacBook Pro also has only USB-C ports, but I'm finding that less of an issue now that many peripherals are coming with USB-C connectors. I like the fact that it has four ports instead of the paltry single port on the 12"" MacBook. I'm surprised how much I like using touch-ID for signing in and the touchbar itself for certain tasks, like archiving or deleting email. I hope the touch-ID can be better integrated online in the future, eradicating the need for entering passwords everywhere.

It has more than met my expectations in most regards. Every aspect of this machine displays quality manufacture, good ergonomics and computing power. This Win10 machine should be useful and contemporary for years. Display: clear, bright, and useful in a wide variety of lighting situations. The screen is not a matte finish and is reflective, so it will show lights and objects in reflections. This has not been a problem, although on airplanes I sometimes have to angle the computer ti reduce reflection from bright objects in a darkened cabin. Resolution of the display is excellent and provides crisp viewing of documents and images. The screen easily displays every fingerprint, and the exterior of the computer tends to show prints as well, but there is an enclosed microfiber cloth which does a nice job of cleaning it up. I've seen reviews which criticize this fingerprint display, but screens generally show fingerprints anyway. Not a big problem for me. Keypad: the touch of the keys is very nice. I can always tell when I have depressed a key. I am able to type fairly fast with no higher error rate than normal. The home/end/pageup/pagedown functions can only be accessed by using the Function key, but that's not unusual with compact laptops; they can only have so many keys. I've become used to using the Function key in combinations as needed. Touchpad: very sensitive. It takes a bit of getting used to, but that's normal whenever you move between machines. The click functions of the main pad and the left/right buttons are easy to control. Speed: this is a very fast machine. Boot-up is less than 30 seconds and it's very responsive. Programs open quickly and operation has been absolutely flawless. TOP marks in this regard, which is one of the most important considerations for me. RAM and hard drive: The 16 GB of RAM and i7 processor make this a very fast machine. I'm confident that I won't run out of storage with the solid state 512 GB hard drive. Ports: It was important to me to have at least two USB-A ports, and I got them. There is also a USB-C port, which is a direction the PC industry is going, so I'm happy to have it. There is also a full size HDMI port which is important because in my higher education environment most projectors and classrooms have full size HDMI connections. There is an SD card port but I typically don't transfer files via SD so I haven't used it. Fingerprint sensor: worked the first half-dozen times I used it, but seems to have decided that's enough. I could try clearing it and re-entering my fingerprint every week, but why bother? I have a 4-character password to access the machine and that's quick and easy. In this regard the fingerprint sensor is no better or worse than most. Touchscreen: The main limitation of the computer is that the touchscreen is designed to open and close programs, drag objects around and carry out similar tasks. It does not serve as a graphics tablet, because its resolution of drawn objects and characters is blocky and rough. It will recognize styli such as the Gosin Digital Stylus, but numbers and characters drawn are blocky. It's not a replacement for a graphics tablet. Weight: it's actually an ounce or two heavier than the 2.8 pounds in its specifications, but it's still the best combination of power, portability and display quality that I have found. It's very compact, fits into a briefcase or backpack, and with the solid state hard drive, it's going to resist travel and handling very well. The folding screen: I like the folding screen which makes the computer into a tablet-like display. Just keep in mind that drawing on the screen isn't likely to result in very well drawn characters. Also be careful if you fold the screen over and sit the computer with the inactive keyboard sitting on an airline fold-down tray; I did this and one of the keys caught on the tray and popped off. ASUS replaced the key under warranty, but since I had to ship it to them (and got it back within 10 days, superb turnaround time) for the replacement, that was an inconvenience. I suspect this caution would apply to most laptops. Bottom line: I REALLY like this computer, love its fast performance and light weight, and find none of its shortcomings to be major issues.","Yes, I would recommend to a friend","http://www.consumerreports.org/products/laptop/asus-q324ua-bhi7t17-387893/user-reviews#user-reviews","Verified Buyer Not Found: : <class 'selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException'>/nVerified Reviewer Not Found: : <class 'selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException'>/n",1

I had steered away from Dell for a couple of years because of reliability issues, but when it came time to buy a replacement Dell XPS had the best feature set balanced with battery performance. This is my Road Warrior system: i7 QuadCore, 16GB RAM, nVidia graphics, SSD, long battery life. Great for long haul plane flights or in a backpack around campus. The thin bezel is outstanding: you really do get a 15"" display in a 14"" package. Mine is a touchscreen and it works great, but not a feature I am accustomed to. Maybe it will grow on me...? The only issue that keeps me from rating this machine 5 stars is the Trackpad. It does not react intuitively compared to all notebooks I've owned previously. Instead of a X-Y touch area and two buttons, Dell has made it one continuous surface with two ""virtual"" buttons outlined at the bottom. I seem to have adapted a two-hand trackpad style where I'd keep my left index finger on the buttons and track with my right. This Doesn't Work! The pad is too sensitive and gets confused when I have two fingers operating it this way. It would be nice if Dell could reprogram the lowest 1/5th of the pad to act only as buttons and not as tracking surface. That would more closely emulate other notebooks I use. I have used this machine for high-end gaming, word processing, LAMP development work, image processing, internet surfing. It excels at everything. It rivals my i7-3770 based desktop for processing power.

For me, buying at Costco was also an appeal. However, I'm on my third laptop -- all this model. The first two laptops I had to exchange within a month. I was hopeful that, maybe, it was a bad batch. Laptop 3 started to show intermittent symptoms within 90 days. Costco encouraged me to hang onto it, rather than make another return, and they teased me with the idea they would be there to support me through warranty, even after the 90-day return time ended. Then the laptop nosedived after six months. Specifically, this model struggles with a beeping/scratching noise, but only if you use the computer for a few minutes or more. So HP won't fix it, because it is intermittent. HP did fix an issue that occurred after six months -- lots of pixel boxes would appear with certain actions on the computer (e.g., trying to use a drop down menu or hovering over a link.) The same fix also seems to have fixed the intermittent issue where the screen suddenly goes to black, and requires the computer to be shut down, rested, and then restarted. That problem is fun when you are working on an important document. HP won't fix the beeping/scratching issue because it's intermittent. Of course, Costco has completely failed to fulfill their obligations as well -- because Costco says to work with HP. Clowns to the left of me and jokers to the right. I'll probably not renew my Costco membership because I am so mad at corporate management for selling a product of such incredibly poor quality, and their ridiculously poor customer service in backing their product or even working with their vendor.

Most laptops that have 10+ hours of run time are often business-class behemoths. However, I have been pleasantly surprised by this device. Not only is it well-constructed, lightweight, and convertible - it also has an extremely good battery! If I slightly modify the power settings, and set the display to 75% brightness, I have gotten anywhere from 7-11 hours of usage on one charge (depending on how I am using the device). The screen on this laptop is gorgeous. It's an IPS display that is comparable to some of Apple's devices. Yes, the track-pad is a bit large, but for a reason. The regions of the track-pad are made to allow several different methods of navigation. Also, the back-lit keyboard is wonderful! The sound is to be expected for a device of this size, but I will say that it's pretty good when placed on a tabletop surface. Lastly, my favorite thing about this device is the solid state drive. The start-up time for this laptop is a mere 5-10 seconds until the password prompt appears.

Background applications require a lot of processing power. I use IntelliJ and Android Studio for programming including Emulators and MS Office for daily routine tasks. These software require immense amount of processing power and Memory. Stepping up from the SDD drives, it feels like night and day. I read about the keyboard ergonomy issues and I disagree with them. Palm of the hand rests very comfortably allowing the fingers to move with ease. I use windows keyboard shortcuts very often and all keys are within my fingers reach, without lifting off hands from the keyboard. Using touchpad probably not the best way to go for such a large screen with high resolution. I use a rolling ball mouse in addition to using the touch screen. I found touchpad to be excellent. Above reviews appear to have stem from the software issues or setting. Integration with LENOVO support, system and LENOVO specific BIOS and driver updates are fantastic. I used HP, DELL and Toshiba before this one. Instructions are generally not clear. Often you end up with downloading software which is already in your system. Sometimes it is not clear which software or version is needed based on your system settings and Windows components. You can have software update listed under your model number however, the slight differences in you specific system set up will require a deeper search and software version check. If you are not familiar with those details, you can download the wrong version of the update which could slow down your computer and cause often Windows Crash issues particularly if the Windows upgrades do not work well with the Manufactures updates and sometimes it can brick your system. LENOVO has a great system check up software and it finds everything needed for your specific system then lists only the specific updates need for your device. This integration makes this process very user friendly and simple to use. Other manufacturers have similar system check software however, non of them provide this function with such reliability and ease. You have to know what you are doing with those systems. I definitely recommend this computer. CONs' Only two 3.0 USB slots. However this compromise allows for greater memory. Hard drive is only 250G. However it does come with a larger HD with more $$. Keep in mind that the DDR is much more expensive than SSD.

It is lightweight and powerful whilst saving you up to 300 pounds on the same spec Macbook pro. Its speaker quality (volume and bass), while other reviewers have rated it highly, I don't consider it to be good. It can also become quite loud as the fan underneath works hard on higher functioning programs. Other than these problems I rate this laptop a great buy as it is relatively fast (8GB RAM) and handles multiple programs with comparative ease with its 256GB SSD. The screen is gorgeous and bright with great detail when watching movies and the battery can give you a long-haul flight without a recharge (about 8-9 hours on battery saver).

I bought her a Lenovo Yoga 910 Limited Edition from Best Buy. It was a display model marked down. It is the most beautiful computer and the envy of the rest of the family. I love it. We have 2 college students, one who is a digital graphic designer and the other studying computer science. I walked into Best Buy a couple of days ago with no intent of buying a computer. However, I saw that a Yoga 910 was open box for an unbelivable $786.00. I asked to see it. It was the store display with fingerprints and dust on it, but GeekSquad certifed. I couldn't resist it and I had told my wife the next computer in the house would be a Lenovo. We have had every brand imaginable on the market in our home and business, but I will continue to buy Lenovo because my positive opinion of my wife's computer. We are giving the new one to my son. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is the shortage of ports, but the Yoga 910 is ioved in our home. It is a pleasure to use and makes one green with envy. My wife is quite pleased. It puts my Macbook Pro to shame and certainly faster than her previous Macbook. NOw in all fairness, our Macbooks are 2009 models, and my Pro is still running strong, but these Yoga are FAST, Beautiful, and well-designed.

Terrible PC. Let's start with the fact that it freezes/locks up far, far too easily and too frequently (once per hour at least, 4-5 times per hour if you're online). It's like going back to mid-90s dial up service with this PC. It's not simply the software either, because I have the same set up on another laptop as well as my wife's computer. I have to do a system clean 10x per day if I'm on more than 6 hours. The keyboard is the worst I've ever experienced - no tactile sense whatsoever. I can't explain it other than it feels too ""flat."" I've been typing on all sorts of computers for 35 years now and this is just awful - you can't get used to it, or get a ""feel"" for it. Installed bloatware & optional software is a problem, even if you remove it safely. NVIDIA re-installs itself every day despite what settings you have on your computer. Very annoying. Another major problem is that this computer (Running the overrated Windows 10) has updated itself 100 times...at least, and you have no control over it. It has sat for 10 hours on several occasions updating itself. But it never does. It can't shut down many times and it will just stay on the restart screen for up to 12 hours. I'm forced to do a safe-boot to get around otherwise I would've be able to use it. The combination of the operating system and awful keyboard is more than enough for me to not recommend it to anyone. This will be the last PC I ever purchase.

I've tried 32GB SD and 64GB UHC cards successfully. With this slot, transferring files from phones, cameras, and other PCs becomes a cinch. Also, it is fast enough to utilize as a permanent hard drive. As a tech consultant, I've been very happy with the Surface Pro 3 for work and personal use. It's fast, powerful, light, has excellent screen resolution and battery life (10+ hours of normal use consistently), and a powerful wifi receiver--it regularly pulls in wifi signals that elude iPads and MacBooks.

Don't even think of charging this laptop with a USB-C cord, that is a bogus sales gimmick of Samsung's. I tried that and after an hour the battery % moved up 1%, a joke! All in all, it's a decent light laptop, but it sacrifices a lot to trim the weight off! The plastic frame around the keyboard and laptop is a weak plastic that can be scratched or warped very easily, not something you'd expect for a laptop in this price range!","No, I would not recommend to a friend","http://www.consumerreports.org/products/laptop/samsung-notebook-9-388637/user-reviews#user-reviews","Verified Buyer Not Found: : <class 'selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException'>/n",1

The touch screen and tablet feature is a great transition always with the dedicated keyboard available. I have to admit, it's odd folding the keyboard 360 degrees backwards for tablet setup and placing the computer down in essence on top of the keys. It turns off so you won't type, but I could see you getting things into the keys if you're not careful. I like the ""tent"" setup where you fold the keyboard back so it looks like a tent. It goes into tablet mode but lets you watch video without having to hold it like traditional tablets. It is a bit slow with the Pentium processor and the physical platen hard drive (not solid state) but all of this is why it's a a very reasonable price. It's still 500 MB of hard drive. Things to consider on these new 2-in-1 machines 1. Most have gotten rid of the CD/DVD drive, this is the case here. I don't miss it 2. Many don't have card readers, this one does which I really like 3. Most have gone down to 1 USB port. This has 3, 1x USB 2.0 and 2x USB 3.0. This was a big reason I liked this computer 4. Most have relatively inaccessible batteries which is the case here 5. Most have limited external monitor ports. Most have only 1 and it's usually HDMI. The most recent are mini-HDMI which means all new cables. This has a standard HDMI which was a big reason I bought this one.

I miss the screen clarity- its like going back to SD after having HD- but I love that when I have an online meeting I know that I won't have to apologize for delays due random restarts/screen failures/keyboard glitches. The speakers are not effective enough for online meetings and I had to use bluetooth. Win 10 made this impossible to manage- each time I had to go deep into settings and reconnect as there is no short cut. Several times I would need to reset speakers completely in order to change speakers. This was an OS issue however if the speakers were effective I wouldn't have had to use other options. Screen went all the way to the edge- I realize now that added to the screen clarity and I miss that. I have Windows 10 on my new laptop and don't have the same problems- Surface Book was always requiring updates and critical error repairs and so far I have not had any of the Win 10 issues that I had continually on the Book. Win Hello works reliably on my new lap top: it did not on Book and the camera would frequently stop working. It also ran out of memory all the time- I was unable to save anything to the pc and carried a portable external hard drive to save everything to.

As far as laptops go, it's a solid performer. I love that it's a true hybrid of a notebook and laptop. Yes, occasionally it will freeze when reactivating from a lid close, but it's only been twice in five months for me. Every laptop I've had in 15 years has had an occasional glitch--even my last one, which was a Mac. Going from Mac to the Surface was easier than I thought. The track pad gestures are similar, but Apple still holds the edge. However, the Surface's touchscreen display is a huge bonus. I use that more than I thought I would. Plus, the processing power of this machine is far superior to the Mac laptop I had. Finally, this is the only laptop I ever had where I *never* worry about finding an outlet by early-afternoon. It can literally go all day on a single charge with moderate to heavy use. Features I really love about it: large screen size, nice keyboard, touchscreen, lightweight, amazingly long battery life and I can truly work with it on my lap without the keyboard getting hot. I also appreciate that the power cord also has a USB slot to charge my cellphone at the same time. The only features I really wish it had -- native HDMI port.

Also, the USB ports make the occasional use of my small and light external drive a snap.

I used the computer to mainly write documents, prepare presentations and use the internet. It has worked fantastically well. I loved the instantaneous start-up time, the good battery life and the general reliability. I've never had any bugs or weird problems. That's why it's so weird that it suddenly died today. I wrote an assignment last night, emailed it to my professor and went to bed. Then, when I wanted to check the weather today, I opened it up and tried to turn it on. No response. I pressed the power button again and again. No response. I plugged it in and let it charge for a few minutes. Still no effect. I looked online via someone else's computer and it looks like a ton of people have run into this problem as well. I tried a number of different ""magic"" button-pressing combinations people attest to online to no avail. I went to the Apple store a few hours ago and the guy there said it's probably due to a logic board failure. That was interesting since many of the people online discussing the same symptoms also noted issues with the logic board. The apple guy was really helpful, at least as much as he could be considering the situation. Replacing the logic board would cost more than half of the original price of the computer, so it looks most reasonable to just get a new computer. But this sucks!!! I would rather have a computer that's a little buggy every once in a while but lasts 4-5 years than one that runs great for just a couple years and then suddenly gives up the technological ghost. The apple guy said he had seen the exact same symptoms before with a malfunctioning logic board and told me I probably did nothing wrong for this to happen, it was just bad luck. It's useful that Consumer Reports provides data on brand reliability. I noticed that while Apple is relatively the best, there is still a frequency of 17% for problematic hardware. I guess I'm just a lucky guy. Would I recommend it? Yes, but I wish you better luck than I had.","Yes, I would recommend to a friend","http://www.consumerreports.org/products/laptop/apple-macbook-air-11-inch-mjvm2ll-a-374085/user-reviews#user-reviews","Verified Buyer Not Found: : <class 'selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException'>/n",1

It has more than met my expectations in most regards. Every aspect of this machine displays quality manufacture, good ergonomics and computing power. This Win10 machine should be useful and contemporary for years. Display: clear, bright, and useful in a wide variety of lighting situations. The screen is not a matte finish and is reflective, so it will show lights and objects in reflections. This has not been a problem, although on airplanes I sometimes have to angle the computer ti reduce reflection from bright objects in a darkened cabin. Resolution of the display is excellent and provides crisp viewing of documents and images. The screen easily displays every fingerprint, and the exterior of the computer tends to show prints as well, but there is an enclosed microfiber cloth which does a nice job of cleaning it up. I've seen reviews which criticize this fingerprint display, but screens generally show fingerprints anyway. Not a big problem for me. Keypad: the touch of the keys is very nice. I can always tell when I have depressed a key. I am able to type fairly fast with no higher error rate than normal. The home/end/pageup/pagedown functions can only be accessed by using the Function key, but that's not unusual with compact laptops; they can only have so many keys. I've become used to using the Function key in combinations as needed. Touchpad: very sensitive. It takes a bit of getting used to, but that's normal whenever you move between machines. The click functions of the main pad and the left/right buttons are easy to control. Speed: this is a very fast machine. Boot-up is less than 30 seconds and it's very responsive. Programs open quickly and operation has been absolutely flawless. TOP marks in this regard, which is one of the most important considerations for me. RAM and hard drive: The 16 GB of RAM and i7 processor make this a very fast machine. I'm confident that I won't run out of storage with the solid state 512 GB hard drive. Ports: It was important to me to have at least two USB-A ports, and I got them. There is also a USB-C port, which is a direction the PC industry is going, so I'm happy to have it. There is also a full size HDMI port which is important because in my higher education environment most projectors and classrooms have full size HDMI connections. There is an SD card port but I typically don't transfer files via SD so I haven't used it. Fingerprint sensor: worked the first half-dozen times I used it, but seems to have decided that's enough. I could try clearing it and re-entering my fingerprint every week, but why bother? I have a 4-character password to access the machine and that's quick and easy. In this regard the fingerprint sensor is no better or worse than most. Touchscreen: The main limitation of the computer is that the touchscreen is designed to open and close programs, drag objects around and carry out similar tasks. It does not serve as a graphics tablet, because its resolution of drawn objects and characters is blocky and rough. It will recognize styli such as the Gosin Digital Stylus, but numbers and characters drawn are blocky. It's not a replacement for a graphics tablet. Weight: it's actually an ounce or two heavier than the 2.8 pounds in its specifications, but it's still the best combination of power, portability and display quality that I have found. It's very compact, fits into a briefcase or backpack, and with the solid state hard drive, it's going to resist travel and handling very well. The folding screen: I like the folding screen which makes the computer into a tablet-like display. Just keep in mind that drawing on the screen isn't likely to result in very well drawn characters. Also be careful if you fold the screen over and sit the computer with the inactive keyboard sitting on an airline fold-down tray; I did this and one of the keys caught on the tray and popped off. ASUS replaced the key under warranty, but since I had to ship it to them (and got it back within 10 days, superb turnaround time) for the replacement, that was an inconvenience. I suspect this caution would apply to most laptops. Bottom line: I REALLY like this computer, love its fast performance and light weight, and find none of its shortcomings to be major issues.","Yes, I would recommend to a friend","http://www.consumerreports.org/products/laptop/asus-q324ua-bhi7t17-387893/user-reviews#user-reviews","Verified Buyer Not Found: : <class 'selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException'>/nVerified Reviewer Not Found: : <class 'selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException'>/n",1

The spreadsheets get fairly large but the Pixel handles everything without breaking a sweat. I've used other chrome books, they are pokey by comparison. I also store all paper files on the church Google Docs account. This allows for complete transparency in accounting, I even have a Toshiba chrome book on loan to church members allowing them to access the documents relating to any financial activity the church is engaged in. I can't think of anything that isn't great about the Chrome Pixel. Of course I live on the web, all my financial documents are in Google Docs, backed up of course to Dropbox and Amazon Cloud Services via Cloud HQ. I have no desire to have anything on my laptops or tablets. This allows me to access anything from any of my devices, tablets, phone etc. Others of you may need specialized software that only works on your pc, in that case a chrome book won't do the trick.

This is my 1st Apple computer after windows based PCs for over 30 yrs. I got tired of basically needing replacements after about 4 years, total system failures, viruses, slow operation, etc. The Apple world does things a little differently, but it's easy to learn and intuitive. First of all, the display is beautiful. It's fast and dead quiet with good speakers. I loaded docs. and extensive music and photo libraries to the iMac without any complications. I also set up a backup system to an Apple AirPort device with some help from Apple support. I also called Apple support on 2 other occasions with technical questions. Each time, I got through to a knowlegeable, courteous technician who sounded like a native English language speaker in less than 4 mins. We also have seamless interaction with our iPhones, iTouch and iPad. An included DVD/CD hard drive would have been nice, but I have a 5 yr. old HP external DVD drive which works fine with the iMac. I also miss the touch screen feature on my last PC. The on/off button on the rear is easy to find by feel, but the USB ports in the rear are a bit of a pain to get to.

About every five years, we ""upgrade"" our desktop iMac to the latest model, thinking that the newer model will be faster, better, easier to use. This is the first year we've been uphappy with the experience. 1) Price: Apple products are purposefully higher priced than competitors, so you are buying a computer that is overpriced compared to the competition. 2) Our new iMac is very slow to start up. It takes about 2 minutes, which seems like an eternity. It also has problems running smoothly between programs, noticeably slower than our last version. With all of the software updates over the last five years, our last model was running slower too, so we expected the newest version to be a noticeable upgrade in speed. Not so. Very disappointing. 3) There is no ""power-drive"" anymore. Like removing the headphone jack from the latest iPhone, Apple just decided that people no longer need to burn CD's, photo disks, or watch DVD's on their computer. Big mistake. Sure, you can buy an external drive and plug it in as needed, but Apple's version is overpriced and has gotten mixed reviews for reliability. We bought a cheaper external drive on Amazon, and it works fine, but it's a pain to have that as an extra on the surface of our desk. Apple seems to be losing focus on their entire line of products. If it weren't for the music iCloud features, I might jump ship.","No, I would not recommend to a friend","http://www.consumerreports.org/products/desktop-computer/apple-27-inch-imac-with-retina-5k-display-mk472ll-a-384905/user-reviews#user-reviews","Verified Buyer Not Found: : <class 'selenium.common.exceptions.NoSuchElementException'>/n",1

Setup was simple and straight forward (NOTE: My model originally came with Windows 8.1. Upon start up, it recommended me to upgrade to Windows 10 for free so I did. This Widows 10 upgrade added a few extra hours to the initial setup). If the most you do on this computer is on the internet, manage your iTunes/iDevices and let your elementary-level kids do their homework then this fits the bill. When you start to do more, this PC starts to falter a bit - the SD card reader is extremely slow (it took hours to copy over files), the DVD door is flimsy (one plastic hook already broke off on mine) and there are some weird behaviors such as the keyboard sometimes won't wake up the computer (but the mouse works and luckily you can also use the power button). I hope a couple of these issues will go away with future Windows driver updates.

Compared to every Windows PC I have ever owned, the Mac Mini has been rock-solid reliable. It is perfect for browsing the Internet, Word Processing, Spreadsheets, and Presentations -- whether using Apple's free Pages, Numbers, and Keynote software, or OpenOffice, LibreOffice, NeoOffice, or Microsoft's bloated Office 365. I like the Mac Mini so much that it is the model I most often recommend to friends considering the switch from Windows, especially since Apple often sells a refurbished entry level model for about $420. Both my parents use Mac Minis and one even uses Apple's free built-in dictation to write a book! To set the record straight re CR's incomplete (biased?) review of the Mac Mini, unlike every other personal computer sold today, Apple provides FREE LIFETIME technical support in their local Apple Stores. Yes, after 90 days telephone and extended hardware repair cost extra, but 3 years of AppleCare (telephone and extended hardware warranty) for the Mac Mini can be purchased for $70 from resellers or $99 from Apple. What other manufacturer provides free in-store support and telephone/extended warranty for so low a cost? Likewise, Apple DOES make a very capable USB keyboard with a ""dedicated number pad on the keyboard"" -- and it costs LESS than the wireless keyboard. Why does CR criticize Apple for CR's buying error? The current Mac Mini comes with two high speed Thunderbolt ports, digital optical audio input/output, Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy -- performance features rarely found on Windows PC costing over $1,000 or more. Adding Apple's $20 Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet adapter enables Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) for maximum network performance. Does the Dell XPS 8900 support LACP? Good luck finding out on Dell's support site, in contrast to Apple's support article about how to ""Combine Ethernet ports."" The Mac Mini is a high-tech bargain loaded with advanced features. If you live near an Apple Store, you can get a lifetime of free in-store technical support. You can use an existing monitor (you may need an inexpensive adapter), USB keyboard and mouse.

It doesn't matter if I use wireless or wired, these processes are consuming all of my bandwidth so, not only is this computer's performance awful, but it effects every other device on the network. I spent almost 2 hours on the phone with Dell technical support (in India) and they could not find a fix. They have elevated the support ticket to higher level engineers who will contact me in 3 day.
