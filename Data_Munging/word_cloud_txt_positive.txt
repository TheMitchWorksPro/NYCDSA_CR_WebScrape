"The Macbook Air is very reliable and provides little to no learning curve."
"I have never owned a MAC. I bought the Macbook Air as a gift to myself. I read the reviews for the Macbook Air & Pro. After seeing them both in person, I liked the Pro but felt it was a little too heavy. I fell in love with the Air at first sight. I strictly use the Air to browse the web, check my e-mail, and to research information. I find it easy to use and I love the long battery life. Also it is very light in weight. With some assistance from my wife, it was easy to set up. So far I have no complaints or regrets."
"This is a great little computer. The price of admission is a little higher (or a lot higher these days), but it's worth it, even without taking resale value into consideration (a traditional Mac strongpoint). I have owned a '07 iMac, still own a '09 MacPro (for work), but the '13 MacBookAir is the best all-round machine of them all. Don't worry about the low resolution of the display; it looks great. It feels plenty quick and snappy for generic everyday use, even after three years; none of the gradual slowing down that seems par for the course on cheaper Windows PC's. It's not powerful enough for heavy duty processing, that's what I have the MacPro for. But the MBA is the perfect desert-island computer. Assuming the island has power and internet, of course."
"Every day use. Even if I have to stop something for a week then you can continue your work without disturbances. It is very easy and friendly. I can write as I am right now resting and even no efforts. I have a prior Mac Book 2008 and used it for 6 years. Bought this one due to its long performance and battery life. I dont have to struggle with uptdate and unwanted problems. I do not use it for gaming or video editing. If you want to do that consider a Mac Book Pro. I have a IMAC that usually do the tough job. Great computer."
"My two Brother-In-Laws work for Apple and are very computer savvy! They have helped me with my Apple computers and have given me a lot of advice about how to use them and what I can do with them. I would recommend these computers to anyone if they have the money to spend on them. They are very, very EXPENSIVE!"
"Love it! Would recommend buying the extra customer support package as you will need the help with software if you are new to Apple like I was. They have the BEST Tech Support Staff I have ever felt with!"
"By far, the best all-around computer I have ever owned. I would prefer if it were a few ounces lighter, the only possible improvement I can think of. I recommend it highly."
"I use this for general home use occasionally (surfing web, hotel research, using CR) but mostly for work related report writing and access to web apps I need."
"My last MBP was bought by me in mid-2009; I had NEVER gotten that much out of a Windows laptop. And Apple's service esp Genius Bar is invaluable. This is about 1/3 lighter than old MBP 13 and only 1/2 pound more than MBA. Brighter and better detailed screen is cool. Thunderbolt port takes mini DVI adapter which is good. I don't like the SSD size limits and how much more, given today's prices, Apple charges for 512 GB vs 256, when in reality it's 249 GB due to OS software. Transition from old MBP was very easy with the transfer software."
"The best of many Mac laptops I've owned for personal use. It lives a hard travel life, doing presentations and maintaining web sites and other communications. Beyond the other reviews and CR ratings, it seems to me that the solid state drives do not need to be oversized the way electro-mechanical drives typically must be for optimal performance."
"Have been using a PC since 1983, so I have a lot of experience. I have Win 8.1 and Win 10. The MAC OS works 1000% better than Windows in my opinion. It is brilliantly laid out with all menus in the logical position. I never could figure out windoes, while I enjoy and trust the MAC. It's hard to give specifics but I have to say I find that Mac OS works much better than Windows. I am extremely glad that I got the MAC."
"I use the MBPro for school and personal use. I'm teaching my son to code using it and we also use it to program small mini-computers (Arduino/Raspberry Pi2). To manage space on the device I purchased a 2TB portable storage device and use it for both data/file storage and backup, using TimeMachine. I disabled TimeMachine backup to the MBPro and that has significantly freed up storage capacity. I have a high-end Dell running windows, and it just doesn't compare in terms of reliability and ease of use to the Apple device."
"Application of latest technology (i.e.. flash drive, Force touch, battery) is a home run. Best value in laptops."
"Replaced 8 yr old Macbook with this. I'm amazed it starts up AND shuts down within 5-10 seconds! And that hasn't changed at all after 2 years. Battery still at 93% original capacity after hundreds of cycles. Industry-leading Retina screen is almost too good. Can't give all 5 stars due to price. Buy refurbished through apple.com for better deal. Interestingly, the CPU fan still gets revved up when streaming video which was a chronic problem with my 8 year old Macbook as well. Note: combination of heavier build plus slick aluminum = drop hazard."
"Upgraded from a MacBook Air which is still be used by another family member with no problems. Reasons to upgrade were: -More Storage 256 vs 128 Gb -Greatly Improved screen (IPS) -Larger Screen Integrates very well with other Apple products. When I signed into my iCloud account on my brand new computer, it downloaded almost everything I had on my MacBook Air including files on the Desktop. Instant on and off, unlike Windows. Apple sells a premium product and it is priced accordingly. I seriously considered buying a Windows machine but when I started looking for one with specs similar to the MacBook Pro 15\", the actual price difference was not that significant. You can buy a much less expensive machine but it will not have the SSD and fast processor etc. Excellent Hardware. I'm particularly impressed with the solidity of the chassis. I purchased a refurbished unit which was discounted 15%."
"Had to replace my 2004 Mac Pro - with a Mac Pro...would do it again."
"This is the best value in a lightweight travel pc. It is beautiful, solid, fast and quiet. Works flawlessly - and looks and feels like a $1200 computer. It's a no-brainer. Just a fantastic value. Plus a very long battery life. And it weighs less that 3 lbs. It's a wonderful computer. The only option it lacks is a backlit keyboard. That doesn't affect my use at all . . . but if you like to work in the dark, you might want that feature."
"Although I've used PCs since 1987, at this point I feel I should've gone to a Mac in spite of the learning curve. Not only did I find Windows 10 frustrating and counter-intuitive, but the laptop is heavier than expected, has an exasperating touch pad and is very slippery to hold. This computer created so many problems during set up that the time wasted may have made up for the time needed to transition to a Mac. In addition I find this just a bit faster than my 6 year old Dell with an I-5."
"This is an excellent computer especially for the price, this is a great deal for anybody in the market of buying a high end computer. I use it mainly for photo editing and uploading photos to the web. I have had no issues at all. It is quick and the photos look very sharp on its display. Apple computers are rated higher and I've had Apple computers before but this computer is MUCH better. I am certain this computer could handle just about anything and I am very satisfied with my purchase."
"I had been looking for the right laptop. This is by far better than I could imagine. It has all the features that you could ask for. It is super fast, love the back lighted key board. The touch screen makes it really easy to use the screen. Then the tablet mode. OMG. It is so easy to use and work with. I find that my work presentations look much better. Dell hit a home run with this Laptop. I am pleased with this big time. For my type of work this is by far the best thing that I could use. Taking notes in class is now the best part of going to school at night. LOVE IT!"
"This is a good budget-conscious entry level computer I bought for my child. The touch screen and tablet feature is a great transition always with the dedicated keyboard available. I have to admit, it's odd folding the keyboard 360 degrees backwards for tablet setup and placing the computer down in essence on top of the keys. It turns off so you won't type, but I could see you getting things into the keys if you're not careful. I like the \"tent\" setup where you fold the keyboard back so it looks like a tent. It goes into tablet mode but lets you watch video without having to hold it like traditional tablets. It is a bit slow with the Pentium processor and the physical platen hard drive (not solid state) but all of this is why it's a a very reasonable price. It's still 500 MB of hard drive. Things to consider on these new 2-in-1 machines 1. Most have gotten rid of the CD/DVD drive, this is the case here. I don't miss it 2. Many don't have card readers, this one does which I really like 3. Most have gone down to 1 USB port. This has 3, 1x USB 2.0 and 2x USB 3.0. This was a big reason I liked this computer 4. Most have relatively inaccessible batteries which is the case here 5. Most have limited external monitor ports. Most have only 1 and it's usually HDMI. The most recent are mini-HDMI which means all new cables. This has a standard HDMI which was a big reason I bought this one. Diplay Port (Dell) and mini-Display Port (Apple) are the others."
"The Product is used by a simply way This Laptop is smallmand we can bring it with us evrywhere and can use it whenever we need it , his software is fast and can make me happy to finish my business work The things that aren't great about it is that is not a good for a movie player or any videos or games."
"I am at the same time happy and realistic. I bought my Stream refurbished to replace an old netbook I had been keeping on life support for years. While my HP Stream is very quick to respond in most areas of my daily regime, it is not a strong multi-tasker. I do consider it a worthy chrome book challenger but feel like it is not the equivalent of my old Acer \"eee pc\" netbook. I do intend to tweak settings and remove HP bloatware and \"make a go of it\" nonetheless."
"Very fast, light, great screen. The digital pen is the #1 reason that I bought this computer. It works great when I need to take notes for school in Powerpoint or OneNote. Definitely recommend for college/graduate students."
"I was curious about the Surface and took a chance when my new employer needed a beta tester. As far as laptops go, it's a solid performer. I love that it's a true hybrid of a notebook and laptop. Yes, occasionally it will freeze when reactivating from a lid close, but it's only been twice in five months for me. Every laptop I've had in 15 years has had an occasional glitch--even my last one, which was a Mac. Going from Mac to the Surface was easier than I thought. The track pad gestures are similar, but Apple still holds the edge. However, the Surface's touchscreen display is a huge bonus. I use that more than I thought I would. Plus, the processing power of this machine is far superior to the Mac laptop I had. Finally, this is the only laptop I ever had where I *never* worry about finding an outlet by early-afternoon. It can literally go all day on a single charge with moderate to heavy use. Features I really love about it: large screen size, nice keyboard, touchscreen, lightweight, amazingly long battery life and I can truly work with it on my lap without the keyboard getting hot. I also appreciate that the power cord also has a USB slot to charge my cellphone at the same time. The only features I really wish it had -- native HDMI port. You have to buy an HDMI accessory."
"I have the middle of the road model with 256 on the hard drive, i5 chip and 8GB RAM. I bought the keyboard also. This computer works well as a desktop. It runs all of the office, acrobat and other stuff I have on it with many programs open. It has never failed. I use it for a law litigation practice. I have it connected to a wide screen curved monitor via display port, a surface docking brick and a logitech k810 keyboard and mouse for office use. Disconnecting is a snap to drop the Surface Pro 4 into a small brief case with a portable mouse and I am mobile in seconds. In court, it fires up in seconds and is ready to go. I have bought two more of these for school aged kids and use theirs all the time. I recommend this system. The only con is no cellular capability."
"I purchased this computer as a portable adjunct to my desktop computer. It is so much more convenient, and faster, than my desktop that it has unexpectedly become my primary computer. While I wish that the batter life were longer, for my purposes it is good enough. (I have the most battery-intensive, and fastest processor currently available on the SP4, an i7.) Most of the time, I can use it plugged in anyway. And the power management seems pretty sophisticated and configurable. I am particularly astounded by the speed with which it operates, thanks in large part to the dependable solid state drive. Also, the USB ports make the occasional use of my small and light external drive a snap. Contrary to the Consumer Reports review, this computer DOES have facial recognition, which is a pleasant alternative to logging in with a password. Whether I am in an airplane, traveling, using the SP4 at a hotel or at home, I am continually delighted by it. After almost one year of use, it still meets all of my needs with ease and grace. Looks great too."
"This machine is feather light and has no noticeable bugs or defects. We have a desperately slow DSL line yet video streaming is much better than the ASUS laptop that I used previously. So far I have not missed having a built-in DVD/CD drive. The disk drawers on my four previous laptops always seemed to pop open if looked at cross eyed."
"This is a Fantastic laptop for the money. The speed and graphics of this computer is amazing as well as the 4K touch screen. The keyboard is well lit and the touch keys make typing a snap. The laptop stays relatively cool and the fan, when it runs,(which is hardly ever) is very quiet! The only thing it lacks is a Ethernet connection that plugs directly into the laptop. If you want to use a Ethernet connection, you have to buy a (Ethernet to USB plug) separately. Also it has no DVD/CD drive built-in, you have to buy a external DVD/CD drive separately as well. Other than those 2 things, this is a beautiful laptop with lots of features and a lot less in price than most laptops with a i7 processor!"
"I'm very happy with my Samsung Notebook 9 pro laptop. It's lightning fast and has a beautiful screen. The keyboard is easy to use and has a backlight. The laptop overall is solid with strong hinges and has a premium look and feel to it. The only negative I can think of has to do with it having 4K screen resolution. The problem is that some apps and programs aren't yet compatible with such high dense resolution screens and therefore the buttons and icons appear very tiny and are hard to read and use. I assume as these types of screens become more common, programmers will design and update apps with this in mind. Otherwise, super satisfied with my purchase!"
"Very nice in general but definitely inadequate for Facetime usage. Processor not capable of handling moving image without major blurring for a few seconds while it processes the image. Also the camera is only 480p and not HD (780) used on the other Mac computers. Other than that limitation it is a very nice computer but way overpriced compared to the Macbook Air available with the Intel i7 processor."
"It fits my needs perfectly and it's a great travel companion. Migrating my information from my Macbook Pro 13 was much faster and so much easier than ever before. If I had to do this over again I would for sure buy the Macbook 12\". I knew the trade offs purchasing the Macbook 12 vs another Macbook Pro 13 and am completely satisfied with my choice."
"It is a good product but because of the slow processor and only 8gb RAM, it wouldn't easily handle multi-functioning. It would wait till one function was done to address the next. Had to bring it back."
"I've used this computer for the last 2 years as a college student. I used the computer to mainly write documents, prepare presentations and use the internet. It has worked fantastically well. I loved the instantaneous start-up time, the good battery life and the general reliability. I've never had any bugs or weird problems. That's why it's so weird that it suddenly died today. I wrote an assignment last night, emailed it to my professor and went to bed. Then, when I wanted to check the weather today, I opened it up and tried to turn it on. No response. I pressed the power button again and again. No response. I plugged it in and let it charge for a few minutes. Still no effect. I looked online via someone else's computer and it looks like a ton of people have run into this problem as well. I tried a number of different \"magic\" button-pressing combinations people attest to online to no avail. I went to the Apple store a few hours ago and the guy there said it's probably due to a logic board failure. That was interesting since many of the people online discussing the same symptoms also noted issues with the logic board. The apple guy was really helpful, at least as much as he could be considering the situation. Replacing the logic board would cost more than half of the original price of the computer, so it looks most reasonable to just get a new computer. But this sucks!!! I would rather have a computer that's a little buggy every once in a while but lasts 4-5 years than one that runs great for just a couple years and then suddenly gives up the technological ghost. The apple guy said he had seen the exact same symptoms before with a malfunctioning logic board and told me I probably did nothing wrong for this to happen, it was just bad luck. It's useful that Consumer Reports provides data on brand reliability. I noticed that while Apple is relatively the best, there is still a frequency of 17% for problematic hardware. I guess I'm just a lucky guy. Would I recommend it? Yes, but I wish you better luck than I had."
"As with the Apple name, everything went as well as it was supposed to go."
"I love my Macbook air! I travel quite often for my job, and it is great to take on plane rides and into hotels due to its small size. It runs very fast most of the time, and has been dropped more than ten times, yet it stays intact."
"I mostly use the computer for business, for writing and photos. The display is amazing, especially for photos and graphics. The body is very thin and light, but solid. The processor is fast. It took a little while to get used to the flatter keys in the keyboard, but after a couple of days, there are no problems. I haven't mastered the touch bar, but I have used the Touch ID for Apple Pay. I am getting excellent battery life, unlike CR testers."
"Overall, I enjoy using this MacBook Pro. It's zippy and plenty powerful for my needs (Photoshop, mostly), and the display is gorgeous. The sound is surprisingly good as well. I got the most storage possible because of all the photography I do. I much prefer the Pro's keyboard to that of the 12\" MacBook (which I use for travel), but I'm underwhelmed with the Pro's battery life; that's its main drawback. At full brightness and only slight Photoshop use, I'll burn through a full charge in around 4 hours just surfing Safari and editing in Word. I have no idea how Consumer Reports gets its massive 17-hour-plus battery results. Like the MacBook, this MacBook Pro also has only USB-C ports, but I'm finding that less of an issue now that many peripherals are coming with USB-C connectors. I like the fact that it has four ports instead of the paltry single port on the 12\" MacBook. I'm surprised how much I like using touch-ID for signing in and the touchbar itself for certain tasks, like archiving or deleting email. I hope the touch-ID can be better integrated online in the future, eradicating the need for entering passwords everywhere. The quality of the machine is excellent, as usual, and for the most part it's a joy to use. Aside from the battery, no complaints."
"I bought this computer primarily for travel and portable use around campus. It has more than met my expectations in most regards. Every aspect of this machine displays quality manufacture, good ergonomics and computing power. This Win10 machine should be useful and contemporary for years. Display: clear, bright, and useful in a wide variety of lighting situations. The screen is not a matte finish and is reflective, so it will show lights and objects in reflections. This has not been a problem, although on airplanes I sometimes have to angle the computer ti reduce reflection from bright objects in a darkened cabin. Resolution of the display is excellent and provides crisp viewing of documents and images. The screen easily displays every fingerprint, and the exterior of the computer tends to show prints as well, but there is an enclosed microfiber cloth which does a nice job of cleaning it up. I've seen reviews which criticize this fingerprint display, but screens generally show fingerprints anyway. Not a big problem for me. Keypad: the touch of the keys is very nice. I can always tell when I have depressed a key. I am able to type fairly fast with no higher error rate than normal. The home/end/pageup/pagedown functions can only be accessed by using the Function key, but that's not unusual with compact laptops; they can only have so many keys. I've become used to using the Function key in combinations as needed. Touchpad: very sensitive. It takes a bit of getting used to, but that's normal whenever you move between machines. The click functions of the main pad and the left/right buttons are easy to control. Speed: this is a very fast machine. Boot-up is less than 30 seconds and it's very responsive. Programs open quickly and operation has been absolutely flawless. TOP marks in this regard, which is one of the most important considerations for me. RAM and hard drive: The 16 GB of RAM and i7 processor make this a very fast machine. I'm confident that I won't run out of storage with the solid state 512 GB hard drive. Ports: It was important to me to have at least two USB-A ports, and I got them. There is also a USB-C port, which is a direction the PC industry is going, so I'm happy to have it. There is also a full size HDMI port which is important because in my higher education environment most projectors and classrooms have full size HDMI connections. There is an SD card port but I typically don't transfer files via SD so I haven't used it. Fingerprint sensor: worked the first half-dozen times I used it, but seems to have decided that's enough. I could try clearing it and re-entering my fingerprint every week, but why bother? I have a 4-character password to access the machine and that's quick and easy. In this regard the fingerprint sensor is no better or worse than most. Touchscreen: The main limitation of the computer is that the touchscreen is designed to open and close programs, drag objects around and carry out similar tasks. It does not serve as a graphics tablet, because its resolution of drawn objects and characters is blocky and rough. It will recognize styli such as the Gosin Digital Stylus, but numbers and characters drawn are blocky. It's not a replacement for a graphics tablet. Weight: it's actually an ounce or two heavier than the 2.8 pounds in its specifications, but it's still the best combination of power, portability and display quality that I have found. It's very compact, fits into a briefcase or backpack, and with the solid state hard drive, it's going to resist travel and handling very well. The folding screen: I like the folding screen which makes the computer into a tablet-like display. Just keep in mind that drawing on the screen isn't likely to result in very well drawn characters. Also be careful if you fold the screen over and sit the computer with the inactive keyboard sitting on an airline fold-down tray; I did this and one of the keys caught on the tray and popped off. ASUS replaced the key under warranty, but since I had to ship it to them (and got it back within 10 days, superb turnaround time) for the replacement, that was an inconvenience. I suspect this caution would apply to most laptops. Bottom line: I REALLY like this computer, love its fast performance and light weight, and find none of its shortcomings to be major issues."
"If you are willing to trade away its portability for performance this is the computer for you."
"Use it to help children learn and explore our world."
"I love this machine. Fabulous display!!! I have the 4K touch display and this is fine on its own, but if you have a second monitor it should be 4K as well, otherwise there are odd screen text size effects within certain applications. . . I recommend the 1TB SSD, and maxing out the memory and this will be the best Geographical Information Science (GIS) PC you have ever owned. It is screaming through my dissertation research, while my older Dell Desktop with more memory, more processors, and a larger HDD was significantly slower. Also while the onboard speakers are pretty good, more is better. . . so plug something in and it is a mini theater experience. Get the i7 processor. I have an 8TB Seagate USB3 HDD that I transfer files to and from and the transfer rates for large files actually average above 100 Mbps and have topped out about 175Mbps, which is significantly under the theoretical max of 640 Mbps. Even so, this is the fastest of any of my PC's for large processing tasks, especially when using ArcGIS Pro V 1.4. The only improvement would be a number pad on the keyboard, there is plenty of extra room on the right and left of the keyboard that it could be fit, and it would make keying in numbers faster."
"I have the nearly fully loaded version of this model; i7, 1TB SSD, Nvidia Discreet Graphics, 4K touch, however I only have 16GB of Ram. In the past I have used Macbook Pros and Thinkpads (T400 and X1). Because I rest my palms when I type I love the rubberized feel of the carbon fiber inside. Keyboard is fine. The nearly bezel-less screen is amazing save this: there is this annoying faint/subtle flicker where the brightness seems to rapidly change and revert within a fraction of a second and it is inconsistent. I have spent over 8 hours with Dell trouble shooting this, until another user captured it on Youtube I think their heavily accented tech support thought I was nuts. Apparently, before I purchased mine there was a horrible on off flicker with the screen that has since been resolved with software, I never experienced that. Anyway, I went in for $2400 on my model, primarily for an amazing screen that I could read on up close, while also being able to edit photos in photoshop without having to worry about it becoming obsolete for some time. If this flicker is ever resolved this is the best available, however with the flicker I feel it diminishes my experience by $1000 to the point where it may end up on ebay to save my eyes"
"I use my new Dell computer for light business applications and heavy peron use. I have found it to be very reliable, especially in comparison to an HP that I returned for constantly crashing. The processing speed is extraordinary, exceeded only by the few seconds it takes to start from \"dead\" start to ready-to-go."
"The Dell 9550 (XPS 15\") tops rating charts on several review sites, including CR. I had steered away from Dell for a couple of years because of reliability issues, but when it came time to buy a replacement Dell XPS had the best feature set balanced with battery performance. This is my Road Warrior system: i7 QuadCore, 16GB RAM, nVidia graphics, SSD, long battery life. Great for long haul plane flights or in a backpack around campus. The thin bezel is outstanding: you really do get a 15\" display in a 14\" package. Mine is a touchscreen and it works great, but not a feature I am accustomed to. Maybe it will grow on me...? The only issue that keeps me from rating this machine 5 stars is the Trackpad. It does not react intuitively compared to all notebooks I've owned previously. Instead of a X-Y touch area and two buttons, Dell has made it one continuous surface with two \"virtual\" buttons outlined at the bottom. I seem to have adapted a two-hand trackpad style where I'd keep my left index finger on the buttons and track with my right. This Doesn't Work! The pad is too sensitive and gets confused when I have two fingers operating it this way. It would be nice if Dell could reprogram the lowest 1/5th of the pad to act only as buttons and not as tracking surface. That would more closely emulate other notebooks I use. I have used this machine for high-end gaming, word processing, LAMP development work, image processing, internet surfing. It excels at everything. It rivals my i7-3770 based desktop for processing power. All things considered, I'd buy this machine again despite its nearly $2k price tag."
"I use the XPS 15 for writing books in WordPerfect. For photo editing. Email. And all common uses. I am overall very pleased with it, but I've had software issues with Windows 10 and with WordPerfect. The former seem to have been resolved by Microsoft updates. The latter my disappear later this week when I receive the newest version of WordPerfect. (I am eternally optimistic)."
"the HP company has installed a lot of unnecessary that is just irritating if you don't want it. I had to delete a lot of junk to get it back to the basics. also, there is only one speaker jack. you can't plug in a headphone with a microphone. One of the worst things that HP has done is they eliminated the windows media player ability to play videos. These things are bad enough that I will never buy another HP computer or never own windows 10 again"
"After 8 months it failed to boot. Geek Squad thinks the hard drive failed."
"First, this added to suite of equipment including iPad air2, Dell XPS8500 and other devices. It has backlit keyboard and blazingly fast Intel processor. Used for business and some personal use. Have MS Office 365 subscription which enables me to access spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations and word documents across all platforms anywhere in USA and Canada. Do heavy duty tax research on line on this HP. Large screen, multiple screen flexibility and software allow me to do considerable amounts of work in short order. Highly recommend this machine. It's size does not recommend portability, rather for me, it is a lean footprint on a large desk surface"
"needs battery saver/charge regulator when plugged in as desk top. always charging not good for battery. feels very solid and tough."
"Really powerful and attractive unit. Exterior is tough. Screen is clear and incredibly legible. Only issue I have is that the system occasionally puts out a hissing noise that is noticeable in quiet environments. Returned the first one I purchased but this one has it as well. Searched and found that this is a known and unsolved issue with this laptop. Would not return though as the price / performance can't be beat."
"I use it when travel. It looks beautiful however its exterior pick dirt fast. The latter could be easily cleaned. I expected more from battery life but it lasted for approx. 5 hours. I use it is power saving mode and it lasts for approx. 7 hours of extensive use including 2-3 hours movie watching. Overall is a great product for the price. I bought it on BestBuy ebay for $900, 512 GB solid drive, 8 gb ram, Intel Core i7. Extremely fast processor. This is a great product for the price."
"Great Deal. Note: HPLOYALTY15 coupon initially did not work until I went to private/incognito browser mode. Who cares that I paid $70 in Taxes. Bottom line is even with taxes I get a: 1. NEW 7th Generation Intel CABY LAKE Processor I7-7500U 2. Intel Graphics 620 3. 16GB RAM 4. FHD UWVA BrightView WLED-backlit touch screen (1920 x 1080) 5. 512 GB PCIe® NVMe™ M.2 SSD 6. Full-size island-style backlit keyboard 7. HP Wide Vision FHD IR Camera with Dual array digital microphone 8. Intel® 802.11ac (2x2) Wi-Fi® and Bluetooth® 4.2 Combo All for a total of $1175 includes shipping and TAXES. Look on all 3rd party sites there are no 7th Generation Intel chip computers to buy that can touch this price. Before buying I went on Dell and configured an XPS13 with the above configuration and it came to $1,849. The Dell XPS got slightly better ratings but not for $744 more making this choice a no brain er. Great deal and thanks for the tip on using your private browser. Greg"
"the touchpad is very sensitive .it moves easily , its annoying . when opening the handle isn't easy to get a good grip."
"I fly every week for business travel. Because of that, I wanted to find a versatile, lightweight laptop that also had very good battery life. That's the configuration that was hard to find. Most laptops that have 10+ hours of run time are often business-class behemoths. However, I have been pleasantly surprised by this device. Not only is it well-constructed, lightweight, and convertible - it also has an extremely good battery! If I slightly modify the power settings, and set the display to 75% brightness, I have gotten anywhere from 7-11 hours of usage on one charge (depending on how I am using the device). The screen on this laptop is gorgeous. It's an IPS display that is comparable to some of Apple's devices. Yes, the track-pad is a bit large, but for a reason. The regions of the track-pad are made to allow several different methods of navigation. Also, the back-lit keyboard is wonderful! The sound is to be expected for a device of this size, but I will say that it's pretty good when placed on a tabletop surface. Lastly, my favorite thing about this device is the solid state drive. The start-up time for this laptop is a mere 5-10 seconds until the password prompt appears. Very impressive!"
"This laptop is a great overall performer. I have the higher resolution version with 2560x1440 which has a very crisp and accurate display. This computer is great for multitasking at work where I have two other monitors connected to it and was a breeze to setup. Recommend not using digital to analog converter cables for the HDMI port. The greatest part about this laptop is the stellar battery life. With the two monitors hooked up, Pandora playing, various Chrome tabs open, Outlook, PuTTy clients open, and various other programs I get about a half days worth of battery out of it. When using it by itself I get easily over a work days worth of life out of it. I fully recommend in order to get the best audio quality out of the internal speakers and headphone jack use EqualizerAPO with the Peace GUI overlay. I made the speakers louder, clearer, and fine tuned all aspects of the audio output. Finally I fully enjoy being able to quickly switch to a tablet at moments notice for a quick lookup of something when I am doing work on it."
"Great About It: * Internet for work-related sites/VPN * Outlook email, appointments, to do's * Powerpoint, Excel and Word for business use. * Cloud document storage. Not Great About It: * \"Owners Manual\"--Comes with DVD, and the laptop doesn't have a DVD reader... * HP website support for \"self help\" very lacking for this model. * Peripherals that are compatible are challenging to find."
"Lenovo YOGA 710-15IKB Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7500U CPU @ 2.70GHz, 2901 Mhz, 2 Core(s), 4 Logical Processor(s) RAM 16G NVIDIA Gforce 940MX DDS R4 2 in 1 (touch screen rotates 360') Windows sign in fingerprint PROs' I use this laptop for computer programming purposes. Background applications require a lot of processing power. I use IntelliJ and Android Studio for programming including Emulators and MS Office for daily routine tasks. These software require immense amount of processing power and Memory. Stepping up from the SDD drives, it feels like night and day. I read about the keyboard ergonomy issues and I disagree with them. Palm of the hand rests very comfortably allowing the fingers to move with ease. I use windows keyboard shortcuts very often and all keys are within my fingers reach, without lifting off hands from the keyboard. Using touchpad probably not the best way to go for such a large screen with high resolution. I use a rolling ball mouse in addition to using the touch screen. I found touchpad to be excellent. Above reviews appear to have stem from the software issues or setting. Integration with LENOVO support, system and LENOVO specific BIOS and driver updates are fantastic. I used HP, DELL and Toshiba before this one. Instructions are generally not clear. Often you end up with downloading software which is already in your system. Sometimes it is not clear which software or version is needed based on your system settings and Windows components. You can have software update listed under your model number however, the slight differences in you specific system set up will require a deeper search and software version check. If you are not familiar with those details, you can download the wrong version of the update which could slow down your computer and cause often Windows Crash issues particularly if the Windows upgrades do not work well with the Manufactures updates and sometimes it can brick your system. LENOVO has a great system check up software and it finds everything needed for your specific system then lists only the specific updates need for your device. This integration makes this process very user friendly and simple to use. Other manufacturers have similar system check software however, non of them provide this function with such reliability and ease. You have to know what you are doing with those systems. I definitely recommend this computer. CONs' Only two 3.0 USB slots. However this compromise allows for greater memory. Hard drive is only 250G. However it does come with a larger HD with more $$. Keep in mind that the DDR is much more expensive than SSD. When compared to other brands, the only one gets close to this price range is DELL with half sized RAM."
"Went and got a great deal on this 710. It came with the latest I7 processor, 2GB dedicated Nvidia graphics card, 16GB hi-speed memory and a 256SSD drive. Doesn't come with an stylus pen for use during tablet mode, but I made due with passive--works reasonably well. Biggest issues I have are the touchpad is flimsy and poorly constructed. Unless the laptop is parallel to the floor, the pad stops functioning and the pointer jams in select mode or completely locks. I also have serious issue with the charger. The power supply has non-retractable pronges. The size will block any other plug use for a standard wall outlet. The adapter plug is tiny, flimsy 90-degree bend and is 1\" away from the audio jack--almost same size. I can easily forsee damage due to inadvertent removal. Unlike the magnetic style plugs, there is no \"break-a-way\" point on the entire cord. Taking it back to see if there's an alternative--probably going to pay more but it's worth it in mho..."
"This is a great laptop 2-in-1 useful for everyday general use. It can support decent quality gaming up to a level but don't expect it to power anything at the top-end. I am a teacher and it has come in handy in it's other modes both tablet and presentation. It is lightweight and powerful whilst saving you up to 300 pounds on the same spec Macbook pro. Its speaker quality (volume and bass), while other reviewers have rated it highly, I don't consider it to be good. It can also become quite loud as the fan underneath works hard on higher functioning programs. Other than these problems I rate this laptop a great buy as it is relatively fast (8GB RAM) and handles multiple programs with comparative ease with its 256GB SSD. The screen is gorgeous and bright with great detail when watching movies and the battery can give you a long-haul flight without a recharge (about 8-9 hours on battery saver). All round a quality buy."
"My wife is a technology teacher with a Master's degree in technology and information systems. She had a Macbook and I have a MacbookPro. Hers was running slow and I even cleaned the hard drive before taking it to Best Buy to have Geeksquad totally reformat it. It was still very slow. I bought her a Lenovo Yoga 910 Limited Edition from Best Buy. It was a display model marked down. It is the most beautiful computer and the envy of the rest of the family. I love it. We have 2 college students, one who is a digital graphic designer and the other studying computer science. I walked into Best Buy a couple of days ago with no intent of buying a computer. However, I saw that a Yoga 910 was open box for an unbelivable $786.00. I asked to see it. It was the store display with fingerprints and dust on it, but GeekSquad certifed. I couldn't resist it and I had told my wife the next computer in the house would be a Lenovo. We have had every brand imaginable on the market in our home and business, but I will continue to buy Lenovo because my positive opinion of my wife's computer. We are giving the new one to my son. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star is the shortage of ports, but the Yoga 910 is ioved in our home. It is a pleasure to use and makes one green with envy. My wife is quite pleased. It puts my Macbook Pro to shame and certainly faster than her previous Macbook. NOw in all fairness, our Macbooks are 2009 models, and my Pro is still running strong, but these Yoga are FAST, Beautiful, and well-designed. I won't buy anything but Lenova from now on and I'm pleased to have found another 910, especially at a unbelievable price."
"After seven months of intensive, almost continuous use (except for gaming) not a single problem, except the microphone gain control doesn't work (not corrected yet, since I do not need it). I would buy this machine again any time"
"This is the best laptop I have ever owned. Or is it the best tablet I have ever owned? This one does almost everything PERFECTLY. I upgraded to the i7 Processor, 500gb SSD and RAM and it is super fast with tons of storage. This is a dream for world wide travel. So light. No more sore shoulders from lugging around a heavy laptop through airports. Microsoft eliminated certain hardware to make it super lightweight. An optical drive I can live without. I can add external devices as the situation arises. But what I wanted is the lightweight portability. It handles autocad without any issues though the screen is a bit small for heavy duty cad work. But this is a business trip. I did run into a situation on a business trip where the lack an ethernet port gave me some problems. It was a very remote place that I worked at overseas and only provided a hard wired ethernet connection. No WIFI and they actually forbade the use of WIFI. Of course I do not travel with the docking station. So I spent one month without a network connection until I could obtain the docking station."
"I like this product because of its speed and how long the battery lasts. I bumped up the speed and memory as I always do. It was costly but as I use my computers for many things including reading with this one as a tablet."
"Normally I find CR reviews to be thorough and thoughtful, but I'm surprised to see that CR has listed under \"cons\" for the Surface Pro 3 its supposed lack of a SD card slot. The slot is there--it is located on the same side as the magnetized power connector, under the flip-out stand. It accommodates MicroSDs, supposedly up to 200GB. I've tried 32GB SD and 64GB UHC cards successfully. With this slot, transferring files from phones, cameras, and other PCs becomes a cinch. Also, it is fast enough to utilize as a permanent hard drive. As a tech consultant, I've been very happy with the Surface Pro 3 for work and personal use. It's fast, powerful, light, has excellent screen resolution and battery life (10+ hours of normal use consistently), and a powerful wifi receiver--it regularly pulls in wifi signals that elude iPads and MacBooks. With the introduction of Surface Pro 4, prices have dropped on the 3, which makes it an even better value. One tip--combine the Surface Pro 3 with the Surface 4 accessories (Surface 4 backlit chiclet type cover and erasable pen), and you can easily save $200+ with very little noticeable performance difference, while garnering the benefits of the Surface 4 accessories/apps."
"I love this computer. It is a quick turn on to all your email, Facebook, files, and internet. Less than 30 seconds and you have access to everything. Easy to carry around. As a college professor, I use this for lectures because of the pen! I mostly use at home for all general use. I have only had an issue with forms from the University. Sometimes I must use an old laptop to be able to maneuver those correctly. That has been a bit of a challenge."
"I purchased the device because it laid great claims that it would answer my attempts to simplify my computer life. Switching from Apple ipad to my windows desktop was complicated. I am very busy and my computers need to serve me. I don't want to spend a great deal of time \"learning the new and improved\" when the operating system I'm have is working. Gmail already keeps me too busy with things other than my business. I don't need or want the operating systems changing to get \"better. But when you want a new device you're forced to change they way you're used to working. I had to purchase the Pro with 8. I run a very successful company and I'm older so for me text which details everything from a desktop appearance is just too small. If I enlarge then formatting on gmail is off. Difficult learning curve. After the Apple this doesn't seem highly intuitive. It's slower that I thought. The screen is difficult to read, glare and the it displays in graytones not black."
"I use the Surface Pro 3 for technical troubleshooting on the various networks where I am a remote administrator. This device is excellent for such an application. It is a full Windows computer in a tablet form factor, with the speed and performance of a much larger laptop. It has reduced the size/weight of what I carry to my clients immensely."
"As a consultant, I am on the road most of the time. The Surface is extremely light-weight, very fast and reliable, the battery life is excellent (10 hours), and the keyboard is quite responsive. The active stylus makes it easy to take hand notes and easily/reliably convert them into typed text. It is quite beneficial that Microsoft has made this tablet/laptop so that I can connect to larger screen and full-sized keyboard using VGA and HDMI."
"It is light, lighter than a Mac Book but you've to wonder how come it's not selling like hot cakes, like Macs do. Well, for one thing it's made with cheap parts, like plastic instead of being all metal. Secondly, the speakers are a joke pumping out a puny 1.5 watts from two speakers that are placed underneath the laptop. Why would you place speakers underneath a laptop? Certainly, they're going to get muffled with the laptop sitting on top of them. Honestly, you would get better sound from a smartphone. To avoid that you can use the Bluetooth, which is very good and hook-in a powerful Bluetooth speaker, but honestly this should be an option, rather than a requirement to get good sound. Don't even think of charging this laptop with a USB-C cord, that is a bogus sales gimmick of Samsung's. I tried that and after an hour the battery % moved up 1%, a joke! All in all, it's a decent light laptop, but it sacrifices a lot to trim the weight off! The plastic frame around the keyboard and laptop is a weak plastic that can be scratched or warped very easily, not something you'd expect for a laptop in this price range!"
"The Macbook Air is very riliable and provides little to no learning curve."
"I have never owned a MAC. I bought the Macbook Air as a gift to myself. I read the reviews for the Macbook Air & Pro. After seeing them both in person, I liked the Pro but felt it was a little too heavy. I fell in love with the Air at first sight. I strictly use the Air to browse the web, check my e-mail, and to research information. I find it easy to use and I love the long battery life. Also it is very light in weight. With some assistance from my wife, it was easy to set up. So far I have no complaints or regrets."
"This is a great little computer. The price of admission is a little higher (or a lot higher these days), but it's worth it, even without taking resale value into consideration (a traditional Mac strongpoint). I have owned a '07 iMac, still own a '09 MacPro (for work), but the '13 MacBookAir is the best all-round machine of them all. Don't worry about the low resolution of the display; it looks great. It feels plenty quick and snappy for generic everyday use, even after three years; none of the gradual slowing down that seems par for the course on cheaper Windows PC's. It's not powerful enough for heavy duty processing, that's what I have the MacPro for. But the MBA is the perfect desert-island computer. Assuming the island has power and internet, of course."
"Every day use. Even if I have to stop something for a week then you can continue your work without disturbances. It is very easy and friendly. I can write as I am right now resting and even no efforts. I have a prior Mac Book 2008 and used it for 6 years. Bought this one due to its long performance and battery life. I dont have to struggle with uptdate and unwanted problems. I do not use it for gaming or video editing. If you want to do that consider a Mac Book Pro. I have a IMAC that usually do the tough job. Great computer."
"My two Brother-In-Laws work for Apple and are very computer savvy! They have helped me with my Apple computers and have given me a lot of advice about how to use them and what I can do with them. I would recommend these computers to anyone if they have the money to spend on them. They are very, very EXPENSIVE!"
"Love it! Would recommend buying the extra customer support package as you will need the help with software if you are new to Apple like I was. They have the BEST Tech Support Staff I have ever felt with!"
"Replaced 8 yr old Macbook with this. I'm amazed it starts up AND shuts down within 5-10 seconds! And that hasn't changed at all after 2 years. Battery still at 93% original capacity after hundreds of cycles. Industry-leading Retina screen is almost too good. Can't give all 5 stars due to price. Buy refurbished through apple.com for better deal. Interestingly, the CPU fan still gets revved up when streaming video which was a chronic problem with my 8 year old Macbook as well. Note: combination of heavier build plus slick aluminum = drop hazard."
"Upgraded from a MacBook Air which is still be used by another family member with no problems. Reasons to upgrade were: -More Storage 256 vs 128 Gb -Greatly Improved screen (IPS) -Larger Screen Integrates very well with other Apple products. When I signed into my iCloud account on my brand new computer, it downloaded almost everything I had on my MacBook Air including files on the Desktop. Instant on and off, unlike Windows. Apple sells a premium product and it is priced accordingly. I seriously considered buying a Windows machine but when I started looking for one with specs similar to the MacBook Pro 15\", the actual price difference was not that significant. You can buy a much less expensive machine but it will not have the SSD and fast processor etc. Excellent Hardware. I'm particularly impressed with the solidity of the chassis. I purchased a refurbished unit which was discounted 15%."
"Had to replace my 2004 Mac Pro - with a Mac Pro...would do it again."
"This is the best value in a lightweight travel pc. It is beautiful, solid, fast and quiet. Works flawlessly - and looks and feels like a $1200 computer. It's a no-brainer. Just a fantastic value. Plus a very long battery life. And it weighs less that 3 lbs. It's a wonderful computer. The only option it lacks is a backlit keyboard. That doesn't affect my use at all . . . but if you like to work in the dark, you might want that feature."
"Although I've used PCs since 1987, at this point I feel I should've gone to a Mac in spite of the learning curve. Not only did I find Windows 10 frustrating and counter-intuitive, but the laptop is heavier than expected, has an exasperating touch pad and is very slippery to hold. This computer created so many problems during set up that the time wasted may have made up for the time needed to transition to a Mac. In addition I find this just a bit faster than my 6 year old Dell with an I-5."
"This is an excellent computer especially for the price, this is a great deal for anybody in the market of buying a high end computer. I use it mainly for photo editing and uploading photos to the web. I have had no issues at all. It is quick and the photos look very sharp on its display. Apple computers are rated higher and I've had Apple computers before but this computer is MUCH better. I am certain this computer could handle just about anything and I am very satisfied with my purchase."
"I had been looking for the right laptop. This is by far better than I could imagine. It has all the features that you could ask for. It is super fast, love the back lighted key board. The touch screen makes it really easy to use the screen. Then the tablet mode. OMG. It is so easy to use and work with. I find that my work presentations look much better. Dell hit a home run with this Laptop. I am pleased with this big time. For my type of work this is by far the best thing that I could use. Taking notes in class is now the best part of going to school at night. LOVE IT!"
"This is a good budget-conscious entry level computer I bought for my child. The touch screen and tablet feature is a great transition always with the dedicated keyboard available. I have to admit, it's odd folding the keyboard 360 degrees backwards for tablet setup and placing the computer down in essence on top of the keys. It turns off so you won't type, but I could see you getting things into the keys if you're not careful. I like the \"tent\" setup where you fold the keyboard back so it looks like a tent. It goes into tablet mode but lets you watch video without having to hold it like traditional tablets. It is a bit slow with the Pentium processor and the physical platen hard drive (not solid state) but all of this is why it's a a very reasonable price. It's still 500 MB of hard drive. Things to consider on these new 2-in-1 machines 1. Most have gotten rid of the CD/DVD drive, this is the case here. I don't miss it 2. Many don't have card readers, this one does which I really like 3. Most have gone down to 1 USB port. This has 3, 1x USB 2.0 and 2x USB 3.0. This was a big reason I liked this computer 4. Most have relatively inaccessible batteries which is the case here 5. Most have limited external monitor ports. Most have only 1 and it's usually HDMI. The most recent are mini-HDMI which means all new cables. This has a standard HDMI which was a big reason I bought this one. Diplay Port (Dell) and mini-Display Port (Apple) are the others."
"The Product is used by a simply way This Laptop is smallmand we can bring it with us evrywhere and can use it whenever we need it , his software is fast and can make me happy to finish my business work The things that aren't great about it is that is not a good for a movie player or any videos or games."
"I am at the same time happy and realistic. I bought my Stream refurbished to replace an old netbook I had been keeping on life support for years. While my HP Stream is very quick to respond in most areas of my daily regime, it is not a strong multi-tasker. I do consider it a worthy chrome book challenger but feel like it is not the equivalent of my old Acer \"eee pc\" netbook. I do intend to tweak settings and remove HP bloatware and \"make a go of it\" nonetheless."
"Very fast, light, great screen. The digital pen is the #1 reason that I bought this computer. It works great when I need to take notes for school in Powerpoint or OneNote. Definitely recommend for college/graduate students."
"I was curious about the Surface and took a chance when my new employer needed a beta tester. As far as laptops go, it's a solid performer. I love that it's a true hybrid of a notebook and laptop. Yes, occasionally it will freeze when reactivating from a lid close, but it's only been twice in five months for me. Every laptop I've had in 15 years has had an occasional glitch--even my last one, which was a Mac. Going from Mac to the Surface was easier than I thought. The track pad gestures are similar, but Apple still holds the edge. However, the Surface's touchscreen display is a huge bonus. I use that more than I thought I would. Plus, the processing power of this machine is far superior to the Mac laptop I had. Finally, this is the only laptop I ever had where I *never* worry about finding an outlet by early-afternoon. It can literally go all day on a single charge with moderate to heavy use. Features I really love about it: large screen size, nice keyboard, touchscreen, lightweight, amazingly long battery life and I can truly work with it on my lap without the keyboard getting hot. I also appreciate that the power cord also has a USB slot to charge my cellphone at the same time. The only features I really wish it had -- native HDMI port. You have to buy an HDMI accessory."
"I have the middle of the road model with 256 on the hard drive, i5 chip and 8GB RAM. I bought the keyboard also. This computer works well as a desktop. It runs all of the office, acrobat and other stuff I have on it with many programs open. It has never failed. I use it for a law litigation practice. I have it connected to a wide screen curved monitor via display port, a surface docking brick and a logitech k810 keyboard and mouse for office use. Disconnecting is a snap to drop the Surface Pro 4 into a small brief case with a portable mouse and I am mobile in seconds. In court, it fires up in seconds and is ready to go. I have bought two more of these for school aged kids and use theirs all the time. I recommend this system. The only con is no cellular capability."
"I purchased this computer as a portable adjunct to my desktop computer. It is so much more convenient, and faster, than my desktop that it has unexpectedly become my primary computer. While I wish that the batter life were longer, for my purposes it is good enough. (I have the most battery-intensive, and fastest processor currently available on the SP4, an i7.) Most of the time, I can use it plugged in anyway. And the power management seems pretty sophisticated and configurable. I am particularly astounded by the speed with which it operates, thanks in large part to the dependable solid state drive. Also, the USB ports make the occasional use of my small and light external drive a snap. Contrary to the Consumer Reports review, this computer DOES have facial recognition, which is a pleasant alternative to logging in with a password. Whether I am in an airplane, traveling, using the SP4 at a hotel or at home, I am continually delighted by it. After almost one year of use, it still meets all of my needs with ease and grace. Looks great too."
"This machine is feather light and has no noticeable bugs or defects. We have a desperately slow DSL line yet video streaming is much better than the ASUS laptop that I used previously. So far I have not missed having a built-in DVD/CD drive. The disk drawers on my four previous laptops always seemed to pop open if looked at cross eyed."
"This is a Fantastic laptop for the money. The speed and graphics of this computer is amazing as well as the 4K touch screen. The keyboard is well lit and the touch keys make typing a snap. The laptop stays relatively cool and the fan, when it runs,(which is hardly ever) is very quiet! The only thing it lacks is a Ethernet connection that plugs directly into the laptop. If you want to use a Ethernet connection, you have to buy a (Ethernet to USB plug) separately. Also it has no DVD/CD drive built-in, you have to buy a external DVD/CD drive separately as well. Other than those 2 things, this is a beautiful laptop with lots of features and a lot less in price than most laptops with a i7 processor!"
"I'm very happy with my Samsung Notebook 9 pro laptop. It's lightning fast and has a beautiful screen. The keyboard is easy to use and has a backlight. The laptop overall is solid with strong hinges and has a premium look and feel to it. The only negative I can think of has to do with it having 4K screen resolution. The problem is that some apps and programs aren't yet compatible with such high dense resolution screens and therefore the buttons and icons appear very tiny and are hard to read and use. I assume as these types of screens become more common, programmers will design and update apps with this in mind. Otherwise, super satisfied with my purchase!"
"Very nice in general but definitely inadequate for Facetime usage. Processor not capable of handling moving image without major blurring for a few seconds while it processes the image. Also the camera is only 480p and not HD (780) used on the other Mac computers. Other than that limitation it is a very nice computer but way overpriced compared to the Macbook Air available with the Intel i7 processor."
"It fits my needs perfectly and it's a great travel companion. Migrating my information from my Macbook Pro 13 was much faster and so much easier than ever before. If I had to do this over again I would for sure buy the Macbook 12\". I knew the trade offs purchasing the Macbook 12 vs another Macbook Pro 13 and am completely satisfied with my choice."
"It is a good product but because of the slow processor and only 8gb RAM, it wouldn't easily handle multi-functioning. It would wait till one function was done to address the next. Had to bring it back."
"I've used this computer for the last 2 years as a college student. I used the computer to mainly write documents, prepare presentations and use the internet. It has worked fantastically well. I loved the instantaneous start-up time, the good battery life and the general reliability. I've never had any bugs or weird problems. That's why it's so weird that it suddenly died today. I wrote an assignment last night, emailed it to my professor and went to bed. Then, when I wanted to check the weather today, I opened it up and tried to turn it on. No response. I pressed the power button again and again. No response. I plugged it in and let it charge for a few minutes. Still no effect. I looked online via someone else's computer and it looks like a ton of people have run into this problem as well. I tried a number of different \"magic\" button-pressing combinations people attest to online to no avail. I went to the Apple store a few hours ago and the guy there said it's probably due to a logic board failure. That was interesting since many of the people online discussing the same symptoms also noted issues with the logic board. The apple guy was really helpful, at least as much as he could be considering the situation. Replacing the logic board would cost more than half of the original price of the computer, so it looks most reasonable to just get a new computer. But this sucks!!! I would rather have a computer that's a little buggy every once in a while but lasts 4-5 years than one that runs great for just a couple years and then suddenly gives up the technological ghost. The apple guy said he had seen the exact same symptoms before with a malfunctioning logic board and told me I probably did nothing wrong for this to happen, it was just bad luck. It's useful that Consumer Reports provides data on brand reliability. I noticed that while Apple is relatively the best, there is still a frequency of 17% for problematic hardware. I guess I'm just a lucky guy. Would I recommend it? Yes, but I wish you better luck than I had."
"As with the Apple name, everything went as well as it was supposed to go."
"I love my Macbook air! I travel quite often for my job, and it is great to take on plane rides and into hotels due to its small size. It runs very fast most of the time, and has been dropped more than ten times, yet it stays intact."
"I mostly use the computer for business, for writing and photos. The display is amazing, especially for photos and graphics. The body is very thin and light, but solid. The processor is fast. It took a little while to get used to the flatter keys in the keyboard, but after a couple of days, there are no problems. I haven't mastered the touch bar, but I have used the Touch ID for Apple Pay. I am getting excellent battery life, unlike CR testers."
"I bought this computer primarily for travel and portable use around campus. It has more than met my expectations in most regards. Every aspect of this machine displays quality manufacture, good ergonomics and computing power. This Win10 machine should be useful and contemporary for years. Display: clear, bright, and useful in a wide variety of lighting situations. The screen is not a matte finish and is reflective, so it will show lights and objects in reflections. This has not been a problem, although on airplanes I sometimes have to angle the computer ti reduce reflection from bright objects in a darkened cabin. Resolution of the display is excellent and provides crisp viewing of documents and images. The screen easily displays every fingerprint, and the exterior of the computer tends to show prints as well, but there is an enclosed microfiber cloth which does a nice job of cleaning it up. I've seen reviews which criticize this fingerprint display, but screens generally show fingerprints anyway. Not a big problem for me. Keypad: the touch of the keys is very nice. I can always tell when I have depressed a key. I am able to type fairly fast with no higher error rate than normal. The home/end/pageup/pagedown functions can only be accessed by using the Function key, but that's not unusual with compact laptops; they can only have so many keys. I've become used to using the Function key in combinations as needed. Touchpad: very sensitive. It takes a bit of getting used to, but that's normal whenever you move between machines. The click functions of the main pad and the left/right buttons are easy to control. Speed: this is a very fast machine. Boot-up is less than 30 seconds and it's very responsive. Programs open quickly and operation has been absolutely flawless. TOP marks in this regard, which is one of the most important considerations for me. RAM and hard drive: The 16 GB of RAM and i7 processor make this a very fast machine. I'm confident that I won't run out of storage with the solid state 512 GB hard drive. Ports: It was important to me to have at least two USB-A ports, and I got them. There is also a USB-C port, which is a direction the PC industry is going, so I'm happy to have it. There is also a full size HDMI port which is important because in my higher education environment most projectors and classrooms have full size HDMI connections. There is an SD card port but I typically don't transfer files via SD so I haven't used it. Fingerprint sensor: worked the first half-dozen times I used it, but seems to have decided that's enough. I could try clearing it and re-entering my fingerprint every week, but why bother? I have a 4-character password to access the machine and that's quick and easy. In this regard the fingerprint sensor is no better or worse than most. Touchscreen: The main limitation of the computer is that the touchscreen is designed to open and close programs, drag objects around and carry out similar tasks. It does not serve as a graphics tablet, because its resolution of drawn objects and characters is blocky and rough. It will recognize styli such as the Gosin Digital Stylus, but numbers and characters drawn are blocky. It's not a replacement for a graphics tablet. Weight: it's actually an ounce or two heavier than the 2.8 pounds in its specifications, but it's still the best combination of power, portability and display quality that I have found. It's very compact, fits into a briefcase or backpack, and with the solid state hard drive, it's going to resist travel and handling very well. The folding screen: I like the folding screen which makes the computer into a tablet-like display. Just keep in mind that drawing on the screen isn't likely to result in very well drawn characters. Also be careful if you fold the screen over and sit the computer with the inactive keyboard sitting on an airline fold-down tray; I did this and one of the keys caught on the tray and popped off. ASUS replaced the key under warranty, but since I had to ship it to them (and got it back within 10 days, superb turnaround time) for the replacement, that was an inconvenience. I suspect this caution would apply to most laptops. Bottom line: I REALLY like this computer, love its fast performance and light weight, and find none of its shortcomings to be major issues."
"Despite CRs take on performance, this model does very well in day to day tasks. Much better than other models I've tried."
"I use the CB3-111 the way many people use a tablet. Pour a coffee, get in my comfy chair, read the news, deal with emails, look at some work docs, research a favorite subject (dog food reviews anyone). This Chromebook gives me speedier performance than a tablet and updates so quickly (every time you turn it on) I don't have to ever think about it. Compared to the still clumsy Windows 10, this is a delight. And why don't I prefer to use a tablet like my wife's Samsung S2 with it's gorgeous graphics? Because I really don't like using a touch screen. I value a solid keyboard. I like to type not swipe. Then there is the price. Full computing for less than $180."
"I am surprised that CR would not list the cost of this product as a con. Cost should be a consideration as are all other attributes. It is a very, very nice product but the cost is too high and out of line with the marketplace."
"I use the Pixel for web surfing everyday, I also use it for casting youtube videos onto my tv via Chromecast. One of the big reason I prefer the Pixel is how well it works with Google Docs, especially spreadsheets. I'm the treasurer for a small church and I use Google spreadsheets for all of my accounting. The spreadsheets get fairly large but the Pixel handles everything without breaking a sweat. I've used other chrome books, they are pokey by comparison. I also store all paper files on the church Google Docs account. This allows for complete transparency in accounting, I even have a Toshiba chrome book on loan to church members allowing them to access the documents relating to any financial activity the church is engaged in. I can't think of anything that isn't great about the Chrome Pixel. Of course I live on the web, all my financial documents are in Google Docs, backed up of course to Dropbox and Amazon Cloud Services via Cloud HQ. I have no desire to have anything on my laptops or tablets. This allows me to access anything from any of my devices, tablets, phone etc. Others of you may need specialized software that only works on your pc, in that case a chrome book won't do the trick. But I think Google has it right, ultimately all software programs will be accessible on or only on the cloud."
"It's my first Chromebook, and I love it so much~ Not like other laptops with Windows OS, it starts so fast, easy to use, and with some surprising brilliant designs... but, when using a new system, I faced some problems, for example, I can not install some useful apps or to resize my pics as a basic function, etc."
"I've had this iMac for just over 1 mo. This is my 1st Apple computer after windows based PCs for over 30 yrs. I got tired of basically needing replacements after about 4 years, total system failures, viruses, slow operation, etc. The Apple world does things a little differently, but it's easy to learn and intuitive. First of all, the display is beautiful. It's fast and dead quiet with good speakers. I loaded docs. and extensive music and photo libraries to the iMac without any complications. I also set up a backup system to an Apple AirPort device with some help from Apple support. I also called Apple support on 2 other occasions with technical questions. Each time, I got through to a knowlegeable, courteous technician who sounded like a native English language speaker in less than 4 mins. We also have seamless interaction with our iPhones, iTouch and iPad. An included DVD/CD hard drive would have been nice, but I have a 5 yr. old HP external DVD drive which works fine with the iMac. I also miss the touch screen feature on my last PC. The on/off button on the rear is easy to find by feel, but the USB ports in the rear are a bit of a pain to get to. I guess that's the price you pay for such a slim all in one computer. As for the price, I think that falls under the category of you get what you pay for. I'm hopeful I'll have fast, drama free computing for a much longer time than I did on my PC's. Time will tell."
"We've owned Apple desktop computers for more than 20 years, we're essentially loyal to the core. About every five years, we \"upgrade\" our desktop iMac to the latest model, thinking that the newer model will be faster, better, easier to use. This is the first year we've been uphappy with the experience. 1) Price: Apple products are purposefully higher priced than competitors, so you are buying a computer that is overpriced compared to the competition. 2) Our new iMac is very slow to start up. It takes about 2 minutes, which seems like an eternity. It also has problems running smoothly between programs, noticeably slower than our last version. With all of the software updates over the last five years, our last model was running slower too, so we expected the newest version to be a noticeable upgrade in speed. Not so. Very disappointing. 3) There is no \"power-drive\" anymore. Like removing the headphone jack from the latest iPhone, Apple just decided that people no longer need to burn CD's, photo disks, or watch DVD's on their computer. Big mistake. Sure, you can buy an external drive and plug it in as needed, but Apple's version is overpriced and has gotten mixed reviews for reliability. We bought a cheaper external drive on Amazon, and it works fine, but it's a pain to have that as an extra on the surface of our desk. Apple seems to be losing focus on their entire line of products. If it weren't for the music iCloud features, I might jump ship."
"I USE IT FOR WEB BROWSING, EDITING MY PHOTOGRAPHS , POWER POINT, WORD WATCH SOCCER. LISTEN TO MUSIC. MIRROR IMAGES OR MUSIC. IT IS FAST DOES NOT FREEZE. HASSLE FREE. EVERYTHING WORKS. NO INCIDENTS OF BEING HACKED OR MALWARE. COMPUTER MADE FOR HUMAN BEINGS. FREE SOFTWARE UPDATES THAT WORK SEAMLESSLY."
"This all-in-one has a very nice design - it can pass as an Apple product. Setup was simple and straight forward (NOTE: My model originally came with Windows 8.1. Upon start up, it recommended me to upgrade to Windows 10 for free so I did. This Widows 10 upgrade added a few extra hours to the initial setup). If the most you do on this computer is on the internet, manage your iTunes/iDevices and let your elementary-level kids do their homework then this fits the bill. When you start to do more, this PC starts to falter a bit - the SD card reader is extremely slow (it took hours to copy over files), the DVD door is flimsy (one plastic hook already broke off on mine) and there are some weird behaviors such as the keyboard sometimes won't wake up the computer (but the mouse works and luckily you can also use the power button). I hope a couple of these issues will go away with future Windows driver updates. As of now, the computer looks nice in my room but I'm afraid to recommend it to others."
"I use it for finances, downloading movies, uploading pictures, online purchases and posting on internet forums. Hands down this is the best computer I've ever owned. Apple has spoiled me with the iMac and it is the only computer I would ever buy again. I have gone through my share of computers from the early Tandy computer to Gateway and Dell and nothing even comes close to the reliability of an Apple. Having spent years with Windows I was reluctant to switch to a Mac machine, but I'm ever so glad I did. Not one problem or freeze up in almost two years of operating this computer which gets used on the average of 8 hours a day, every day of the year. I love the fact that upgrades come with it."
"The display is impressive: large, bright, and very sharp. My old Dell display which I'm using side-by-side looks blurry by comparison. If there's a downside, it's this: once you get used to this display, you're going to be unhappy if you have to use anything less. I got the model with the fastest processor and a pure SSD rather than the the Fusion Drive. My main use is software development and performance has been excellent with no significant problems during the nearly 8 months I've used it. I recommend swapping the mouse for the Force Touch Trackpad if you have the option. I also have the mouse but find I seldom use it because the trackpad works so well (it puts the one on my Windows laptop to shame). I'm hard-pressed to think of any downsides unless you like to tinker with hardware. The memory is user replaceable (and I've increased mine significantly), but no other components are user serviceable so think carefully about your system configuration."
"Replaced a Windows computer with the Apple 27 in Mac. Great choice. Apple is really good at hardware. We have iPads and now we have an iMac. No looking back. Setup is easy. Added a Time Capsule for 2TB storage and backup. Seamless. Google Chrome and Gmail work great on this, and the 5k display is out of this world"
"The high resolution (5K) makes it easier to read electronic versions of the Chicago Tribune; and e-mail, etc. The high resolution brings out flaws in my low-light 1080p HD from my new Canon F500 video camera."
"I am on my second Mac Mini, after upgrading to the newer, \"Late 2012', version. I use the computer for personal use only and do not do games. The Mac Mini does everything I want in way of eMail, Internet surfing, and office operations (MS Office). This includes many spread sheets, and over 10,000 photos. The built in Wi Fi is useful and storage is quite adequate.. Pros: > It's an excellent and affordable introduction to Mac, enabling the use of an existing monitor, or upgrading to a wide screen monitor. > The small size for a desk top is nice, making for a neat, clutter-free desk top. > The memory is quite adequate for my use. > The monitor or keyboard can be replaced without involving the computer at all. Cons: The MacMini probably wouldn't be sufficient to handle much gaming."
"I use the Mac Mini for everything from recording over-the-air TV shows to acting as a caching server for other Apple devices in my household. Compared to every Windows PC I have ever owned, the Mac Mini has been rock-solid reliable. It is perfect for browsing the Internet, Word Processing, Spreadsheets, and Presentations -- whether using Apple's free Pages, Numbers, and Keynote software, or OpenOffice, LibreOffice, NeoOffice, or Microsoft's bloated Office 365. I like the Mac Mini so much that it is the model I most often recommend to friends considering the switch from Windows, especially since Apple often sells a refurbished entry level model for about $420. Both my parents use Mac Minis and one even uses Apple's free built-in dictation to write a book! To set the record straight re CR's incomplete (biased?) review of the Mac Mini, unlike every other personal computer sold today, Apple provides FREE LIFETIME technical support in their local Apple Stores. Yes, after 90 days telephone and extended hardware repair cost extra, but 3 years of AppleCare (telephone and extended hardware warranty) for the Mac Mini can be purchased for $70 from resellers or $99 from Apple. What other manufacturer provides free in-store support and telephone/extended warranty for so low a cost? Likewise, Apple DOES make a very capable USB keyboard with a \"dedicated number pad on the keyboard\" -- and it costs LESS than the wireless keyboard. Why does CR criticize Apple for CR's buying error? The current Mac Mini comes with two high speed Thunderbolt ports, digital optical audio input/output, Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy -- performance features rarely found on Windows PC costing over $1,000 or more. Adding Apple's $20 Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet adapter enables Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) for maximum network performance. Does the Dell XPS 8900 support LACP? Good luck finding out on Dell's support site, in contrast to Apple's support article about how to \"Combine Ethernet ports.\" The Mac Mini is a high-tech bargain loaded with advanced features. If you live near an Apple Store, you can get a lifetime of free in-store technical support. You can use an existing monitor (you may need an inexpensive adapter), USB keyboard and mouse. For what you get with the Mac Mini, in my opinion it is a bargain!"
"This is an excellent computer for basic home needs: I converted to the Mac Mini after many decades of PC. It is my second MacMini, and I would never go back. I still need a PC for one specific program that is not compatible with Mac., which enables me to compare the two. The MacMini is excellent for: > Home bookkeeping, spreadsheets, correspondence, email, Google. photo work. Fits well into a home network. > The memory, although small, is more than adequate for home use. It holds over 7,500 photos and is less that 25% full. > A MS Office program (extra cost) is still required. It runs well on the Mac Mini. > The typical Apple setup is a pleasure to use, although there is a fair learning curve when switching from PC. > Mac updates are infrequent, whereas the PC is ongoing. > You will also require a MS Office app.and a monitor. > The MacMini is not suitable for gaming. I would strongly recommend Apple's Protection Plan. Their support is great, and well appreciated in the early stages."
"This computer is user friendly and has no tower taking up space. I love the wireless mouse and keyboard. It was in the price range I was looking for."
"I bought this for home use - internet, email, kids homework, etc. it is a great computer and it could not be easier to use."
"Great offering but it came with a 32GB M.2 card in Raid 0 to work with the 2TB 7200rpm included HDD. I purchased a separate M.2 PCIE card to mount a 512GB M.2 card to run as my boot drive with Windows 10 Pro instead of the Home version. This gives it a better startup speed and applications run faster too."
"Before retiring, I was definitely a compute-intensive user. Now I am not a user that needs big computing muscle, so this computer probably is a bit of over-purchase for my needs. But I remain a loyal Dell fan, and I certainly love computing speed. Advice: I buy the four-year warranty, and always find it worth the price. After a couple of years of ownership, it is easy to forget something you once knew about the gazillion facts/properties of the computer. Then a quick call saves me the time of muddling through an issue on my own."
"Very fast,quiet.I got it new for $550.Very good value."
"You will have to upgrade the graphics card on this computer for gaming. Why a Blu-Ray burner is not standard on this type of machine was shocking to me. There is no room in the case for upgrading much and the power supply is limiting. I upgraded the video card and will probably upgrade the power supply. The BIOS is a mess on this motherboard. It is very difficult to turn off the on-board graphics in the BIOS. With a few upgrades to this already 700.00 machine it could be fantastic."
