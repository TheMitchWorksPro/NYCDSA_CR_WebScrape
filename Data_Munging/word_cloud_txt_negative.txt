"Things that are not so great about it not enough memory, memory card is not working properly."
"As a father of 3 college kids, we have extensive (and expensive) experience with Apple products (4 laptops and 2 Macs). The last two MacBooks (one a MacBook Pro and the other a MacBook Air) were bought within the last 18 months and are both being used by college students. The screen on the Pro has developed a 1\" black vertical line and Apple said, \"screens just malfunction sometimes.\" Cost to replace? $500. For the price you pay for their products, I'd like to think I'd get more than a few months out of them. The logic board on the Air is already acting up. Replacement cost? North of $400. Both were just out of the warranty period. I hoped my assumption that Apple was of higher quality would eliminate the need to spend even more on extended warranty. I was wrong. Totally fed up with Apple!"
"Our first MacBook Pro kept breaking. The thing looked immaculate on the outside, but could not keep running for more than 1-2 months between service repairs. Thank god for the extended Warranty. Parts were replaced regularly because the tech could not figure out the problem. After the 7th repair, replacing cables, motherboard, hard drive, RAM, etc, I finally called Apple and they gave us a new one. I give 2 stars because they replaced it and the second Pro is still working without fail. My confidence is still low."
"This is the first review I've written for CR after 40 years as a subscriber, so obviously I'm upset. I bought this in January after reading CR's take. Maybe mine is just a lemon. Amazon wouldn't take it back, making this the last time I'll buy a computer from them (bought 3 others in the past). Apparently Best Buy will service what you buy for a year. In any event, the touch pad is maddening, the keys often don't work, and in some ways it is actually slower than my 6 year old software glutted Acer 1430z with Windows 7 (which was half the price). Also Windows 10 is not as intuitive as 7 and doesn't seem to work as well with my Home Group. As a PC user since 1988 I was reluctant to go to a Mac. I guess I was wrong."
"After 1 year and only 300 hours of use, the unit randomly overheated, and fried itself to a crisp. It is 1 month outside of warranty, and now it is more expense to repair than replace. I will never buy a Lenovo again."
"The laptop has excellent specs, and the laptop matches those specs. However, the keyboard is so poor, that it is practically unusable: has flimsy keys, non-conventional layout of enter & shift key, and horrible registry settings for keyboard. I have spent countless hours trying to get it right, but it is still not right (I have been programming for > 25 years now). Never typed on a keyboard this lousy. As a summary, imagine a porsche with a sticky steering wheel; it feels like that to me. I cant use it and cant throw it away. I have often carried my 10-keyless keyboard in my backpack to use as a keyboard. Just ridiculous. And... poor memory speed if somebody wants to use for multimedia applications."
"I ended up having to move on to a more reliable lap top after continual issues for 18mths. I miss the screen clarity- its like going back to SD after having HD- but I love that when I have an online meeting I know that I won't have to apologize for delays due random restarts/screen failures/keyboard glitches. The speakers are not effective enough for online meetings and I had to use bluetooth. Win 10 made this impossible to manage- each time I had to go deep into settings and reconnect as there is no short cut. Several times I would need to reset speakers completely in order to change speakers. This was an OS issue however if the speakers were effective I wouldn't have had to use other options. Screen went all the way to the edge- I realize now that added to the screen clarity and I miss that. I have Windows 10 on my new laptop and don't have the same problems- Surface Book was always requiring updates and critical error repairs and so far I have not had any of the Win 10 issues that I had continually on the Book. Win Hello works reliably on my new lap top: it did not on Book and the camera would frequently stop working. It also ran out of memory all the time- I was unable to save anything to the pc and carried a portable external hard drive to save everything to. Critical updates took up every bit of memory and could not be deleted. I miss the clarity but the glitches were impossible to work through."
"I'm a programmer with excellent Windows and Linux IT admin experience. When this machine works, it's great: fun to use, good looking, crisp display. Unfortunately, I have spent countless hours dealing with crashes, hardware hickups, updates, unexpected reboots, display quality problems, complete re-installs, and more. Issues: - Bad display scaling when using a second monitor. - Bottom keyboard / touchpad randomly stop working. - Start menu randomly produces critical error. - Chrome crashes constantly. - Windows Hello randomly doesn't work. - BSOD - Battery: actually get 6-7 hours, when promised 12 hours. - list goes on"
"use it for online banking, and microsoft office for communication,and browsing the net."
"I am currently on my second Surface 4 and have spent around 100 hours trying to fix and restore this computer. Microsoft will not refund. They only replace with another computer that doesn't work! What do I do? This is my work computer! How do I take action?"
"This is very lightweight, also why I purchased. It stopped working, gave me an error message. I sent it back for repair and they voided the warranty because of two tiny dents in the bottom of the computer. Like TINY. I'm so angry, I'll never buy from them again. Read the forums, this is how they steal money from all of us, no rebates, voided warranties, horrible."
"Less than two weeks seeking Tech Support. Will not boot up on battery side of operation. Techs are week in speaking English fluently. E-Commerce Department is uninterested in Customers ( Third Party Outsourcing). GOOD Luck... This purchased has turned into a disaster. Samsung will not allow an adverse of their products."
"Very excited taking the laptop/tablet out however first power up which took over five minutes (before updates were loaded which was another 30 minutes) indicated what \"Bloatware\" means. Startup was agonizingly slow due to Acer's unnecessary startup programs and apps added to it. Impressed by the 2 in 1 features and the display is very sharp, tablet mode is a little sloppy but workable. Apps I commonly use were not available via Windows 10 app store so I loaded Chrome to get Amazon Music and some other apps. Chrome initially loaded, but after trying to make it default browser it wouldn't load anymore in tablet or desktop mode? Not sure if this is a Windows 10 thing or what? I bought Office 360 and when trying to load the laptop was hung up and it never loaded. I have very good high speed access and never had issues with existing work laptop or my old iPad? Lastly, when the sleep mode would kick in it wouldn't respond when you tried to wake it up, even to the point of trying to power it down/up? This gorgeous 2 in 1 became way too frustrating to use, despite the great deal at Best Buy this unit is going back on their shelf..."
"The touchscreen on mine had a manufacturer defect that made it unusable. I reviewed the Dell support forum and this has been a known issue with this model dating back to at least November 2014. When I returned it to the store, they informed me a number of Inspiron 13 2-in-1s had been returned for the same issue - I exchanged it for a similar Acer. CR - please investigate if there should be a recall."
"I bought Dell xps 13 from Costco, and found it made noise (cracking sound) in speakers and headphone after 4 months of purchase even if I did nothing, or even before I login. I googled, and found several users complained the same issue. I called tech support. They upgraded OS and drivers, but the issue was not resolved. They sent in a on-site tech guy to change the motherboard (the sound card is built-in on the motherboard), but it does not help either. They asked me to send the laptop to Texas service center, and changed fan, hard drive, main logic board, heatsink, LCD cable, and reinstalled the OS. This is a 4 month old laptop. I regret I did not purchase Costco extended warranty."
"I have to return computer after 100 days to replace mother board"
"The Dell XPS 15 is a wonderful laptop that is plagued with a constant horrible squealing and screeching noise called Coil Whine. The laptop is sleek, polished, very powerful and sports a beautiful 4K display for movies and games. The GTX 1050 this laptop comes with can run some of the latest games out there on medium to high settings with at least 30fps. This could have very well been the greatest laptop ever created, except for one thing. Coil Whine. This isn't an isolated incident either. This is happening to over half of the Dell XPS 15 laptops sold. Coil Whine is a horribly annoying screeching sound a laptop or desktop can make. It comes from a vibrating coil from the GPU. The Dell XPS 15 would have been a wonderful machine to do EVERYTHING on, if it didn't constantly make a horrible screeching noise while doing it."
"Purchased new. Optical drive defective from the start. Returned to store."
"This computer has been a problem since I purchased it. First the software was corrupted and I had to contact HP and Microsoft to get the computer to even work. Now it works but it is massively slow to the point where I have gone back to my old laptop. Replaced the old laptop when I dumped a latte on it- even shorted out and ten years old it is still quicker and more effective than this paperweight. What a waste of money. Try to contact the companies involved and you just play phone tag."
"Nothing good about it. I have spent hours on the chat with techs and still not fixed. Mailed back to them. They out a new hard drive in and it is still not running right. Super Slow!!!!"
"MOTHERBOARD FAILED AFTER 1 YEAR,7 REPS AND WAS TOLD TO SEND 450.00 FOR A BOX TO SEND IT TO THEM,I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR A NEW MOTHER BOARD...MY COMPUTER WAS WELL TAKEN CARE OF ,NO SPILLS ,NO DROPPING AND STORED IN A COMPUTER BAG,IOOO.OO DOLLARS DOWN THE DRAIN ...THANK YOU HP FOR NOT BACKING YOUR PRODUCTS,THE COMPUTER REPAIRMAN TOLD ME TO START LOOKING FOR A NEW ONE,GRANTED IT WILL NEVER BE AN HP AGAIN...MACEL L. COMPTON"
"The combination of features with this computer are appealing (e.g., 17-inch screen, lots of memory, great sound quality, solid processor, touchscreen.) For me, buying at Costco was also an appeal. However, I'm on my third laptop -- all this model. The first two laptops I had to exchange within a month. I was hopeful that, maybe, it was a bad batch. Laptop 3 started to show intermittent symptoms within 90 days. Costco encouraged me to hang onto it, rather than make another return, and they teased me with the idea they would be there to support me through warranty, even after the 90-day return time ended. Then the laptop nosedived after six months. Specifically, this model struggles with a beeping/scratching noise, but only if you use the computer for a few minutes or more. So HP won't fix it, because it is intermittent. HP did fix an issue that occurred after six months -- lots of pixel boxes would appear with certain actions on the computer (e.g., trying to use a drop down menu or hovering over a link.) The same fix also seems to have fixed the intermittent issue where the screen suddenly goes to black, and requires the computer to be shut down, rested, and then restarted. That problem is fun when you are working on an important document. HP won't fix the beeping/scratching issue because it's intermittent. Of course, Costco has completely failed to fulfill their obligations as well -- because Costco says to work with HP. Clowns to the left of me and jokers to the right. I'll probably not renew my Costco membership because I am so mad at corporate management for selling a product of such incredibly poor quality, and their ridiculously poor customer service in backing their product or even working with their vendor. Bottom line: Don't be a fool like me -- avoid this computer like the plague. I'm going to avoid HP as well."
"Use my laptop as a desktop, connected to external monitor and keyboard. So I don't use the touch pad or display. This laptop can't go more then a day without crashing. Still useful for web browsing and entertainment, but do not use it for important tasks; save your work often! Updated device drivers do not fix the underlying hardware issue."
"I did ALOT of research prior to purchasing this lap top. It does have a beautiful screen and it is extremely lite. However, I had it less than a week before I had to return it. The WIFI would disconnect repeatedly....like every five minutes. Then it would take 10-20 minutes before it would reconnect. I called HP tech support and they told me there was nothing wrong with the computer and that I needed a higher frequency router. This is a laptop...which is made to be taken places. How am I supposed to change the frequency on those routers??"
"This seemed like a really good laptop at first as it was very light, fast, had a nice keyboard, long battery life and could convert to tablet mode. Unfortunately, I discovered that the touchpad had multiple functions that were not clearly defined. As a result, I often unintentionally hit other functions when I was intending to left click or right click. It became annoying after a while. The touchpad was also too wide and it felt uncomfortable on the wrist going back and forth to left click or right click. I was forced to return it for a refund."
"I will fix my MacBook pro, its worth it... this isn't."
"Very heavy to take with you. Cannot access easily to repair which I just found out. They said it's my operating system that went bad. A computer expert says it's the hard drive and they refused to say that! Now I'm sending it back because tech support tried to fix the operating system over the phone and she could not do it. NOW they tell me to send the computer back. But first they told me to take it to the \"GEEK SQUAD\" A group of \"college kids\" who do this to get through college, to see if they can retrieve any of my \"NEW\" downloads, which will be lost once they get their hands on it...and the expense of re downloading is on ME because THEIR computer crashed in 8 months!! I already took it to \"an expert\" who has worked on repairing computers for over 20 yrs...but he \"doesn't know what he's doing!! I was also told that this happened because I upgraded to Windows 10. \"Windows 10 updates itself and causes lots of problems\" Oh, so anybody who buys a LENOVO should not upgrade to Windows 10, it crashes you computer! So far everything I was told about this problem was MY fault...I guess the customer is always wrong!"
"Screen and keyboard, touchpad work really good. Initially i was happy about my purchase Over time i noticed several annoying drawbacks : The battery life is really bordering on poor and can't really finish a longer movie. The fan is noisy, with a high whining noise and dampens the experience, while webcam or movie watching. wifi range is awful. Of all the devices i have, it is far the worse and limits the usability in the house. While weight and handling are great, i have to say it is not as good as i thought initially."
"Hinge fell apart so need to clip it to keep it open to use it (waiting to get it fixed); screen and monitor separated; sometimes need to reboot when sound stops for no apparent reason; poorly laid out keyboard."
"This issue doesn't apply to all Lenovo keyboards but is a deal killer for me on the models where it does apply. The shift key is further to the right than on any keyboard I've ever used. The reason it is further right is the PAGE UP key has taken its place. Not only have you not capitalized the letter you were typing but you've got to go find your cursor. Bad idea! It's a shame but for heavy typing use, I'm looking for a replacement."
"I have spent hours researching laptops for my daughter to take with her to college. I finally settled on this computer being the best choice for her, only to learn just before spending $800.00 on this machine that there is NO security cable port designed into it. WHAT IS THE LOGIC HERE? I even called Lenovo directly to confirm this information and yes, there is NO WAY to secure this computer in a college setting."
"The customer service for Lenovo has been a nightmare. I had 2 dropped calls before getting through to a human, which took 25 minutes. Each time I tried to chat their website crashed. My computer came with MS Office pre-loaded, but no product activation key and no account set up. No one there can figure out how to fix it. So, I am stuck waiting on hold endlessly."
"This has been a disaster. We paid extra for this computer and now have encountered numerous problems where it freezes up or it simply will not start. Research online (now that we know what to look for) reveals this has been a longstanding problem with this line of Lenovo computers. So, bad on Lenovo and bad on Best Buy for choosing to sell a defective line of products. It was shipped out for repairs for 2 weeks. It came back with everything wiped. Within 10 minutes, it shut down and refuses to start. Please, Consumer Reports, do not recommend this to anyone except maybe enemies."
"The shift key on right side is small. The page up key is placed wrong:where you would normally tap a wide shift key Shift and return are wide on most keyboards. Constantly hitting page up key by accident is infuriating if you are trying to type documents. I took it back to the store and the tech support guy stated that he got it that this was totally annoying. He suggested that I remove the page up key so I wouldn't touch it by mistake as this key is in the wrong position and there is no software to change the function of the page up key to make it a shift key"
"I've reserved judgement for this item until I had it a while. Terrible PC. Let's start with the fact that it freezes/locks up far, far too easily and too frequently (once per hour at least, 4-5 times per hour if you're online). It's like going back to mid-90s dial up service with this PC. It's not simply the software either, because I have the same set up on another laptop as well as my wife's computer. I have to do a system clean 10x per day if I'm on more than 6 hours. The keyboard is the worst I've ever experienced - no tactile sense whatsoever. I can't explain it other than it feels too \"flat.\" I've been typing on all sorts of computers for 35 years now and this is just awful - you can't get used to it, or get a \"feel\" for it. Installed bloatware & optional software is a problem, even if you remove it safely. NVIDIA re-installs itself every day despite what settings you have on your computer. Very annoying. Another major problem is that this computer (Running the overrated Windows 10) has updated itself 100 times...at least, and you have no control over it. It has sat for 10 hours on several occasions updating itself. But it never does. It can't shut down many times and it will just stay on the restart screen for up to 12 hours. I'm forced to do a safe-boot to get around otherwise I would've be able to use it. The combination of the operating system and awful keyboard is more than enough for me to not recommend it to anyone. This will be the last PC I ever purchase. My mom and wife have MACs and I've learned that they are superior machines. 25 years buying PCs has come to an end."
"Completely unreliable. It has crashed on me during a timed exam, before a presentation. It now won't charge. Thankfully, I have another computer to look up things like \"what to do when your cursor stops working\", What to do when your Surface crashes\" , \"What to do when your Surface qon't open\", etc. I would love to get a refund."
"Terrible. the surface pro 3 has a lighter screen and then it breakS!"
"Oh, the OS is way too big a change (from win 7) for me. Unfortunately my old Dell died."
"Things that are not so great about it not enough memory, memory card is not working properly."
"Our first MacBook Pro kept breaking. The thing looked immaculate on the outside, but could not keep running for more than 1-2 months between service repairs. Thank god for the extended Warranty.

"Just bought 200 of these Chromebooks for my school. Very disappointed. 2 failed out of the box, 8 others failed on the first day of use, then 4 more second day. Seems Lenovo has a power issue where the device will not turn on. Do not recommend."
"I purchased a similar model, a Toshiba Chromebook CB30-C in June of 2016. In May of 2017, it broke down while still in warranty. Toshiba promised a 10 business day turnaround on repairs. They sent a box for me to ship the device and charged me $22 to ship it to them, which I did. Their website has a place where you can look up the repair status, but there is no telephone support at all if you have questions on the status of your device. 10 Business days came and went. The status on my device said the repair needed a part that could delay the repairs \"up to another 10 business days.\" Those additional 10 business days came and went. Still no repaired device. Still nobody to ask about it. Nobody to complain to or escalate the issue. No additional information has been posted and I have been out of my Chromebook for over a month with no end in sight. I Googled Toshiba service complaints and discovered something I wished I had known before I wasted hundreds of dollars. There were dozens of complaints quite similar to my own. TOSHIBA SERVICE IS HORRENDOUSLY BAD! People who have experienced similar issues have not received their devices back for many more months than me. I have also read where the Toshiba Corporation has been ridden with scandals and the CEO was forced to resign in disgrace two years ago. DO NOT BUY A TOSHIBA CHROMEBOOK."
"Right out of the box it hung itself up on first start. After 30 minutes with tech support it finally finished the start process. Next I clicked one of the 3 desktop icons about the integrated 3D webcam, only to find that the system didn't see the webcam. Unfortunately, Eluktronics tech support left 30 minutes early so I couldn't get any help. In their defense, it was a Friday afternoon. Today I find that my Yeti Blue microphone doesn't work properly with the system. It's Sunday so no tech support today."
"Fantastic display, but it struggles to display PDFs. It is dramatically slower than my 2yr old MacBook Air. Apple has spent weeks trying to find the problems, but there are clearly some hardware problems with this machine. Wait for the next generation."
"Wary hard to get technical support (almost impossible ).Warranty department doesn't exist . Even they have warranties for product it is almost impossible to claim it unless you have unlimited time to proceed . Technical stuff in support department is trained to delay and telephone lines are designed to let you wait couple hours before somebody returns your call . You are risking sanity if you by any product of this company and something happen to it and you need help."
"Now I understand why I got this one so cheap. I didn't pay much for it on sale. They gave me another $70 off when I insisted on returning it. Hated it every since, MISTAKE."
"KHMilder, again. I forgot to mention that when I first did the auto-installation of Windows 10 Pro, the last part of the process was to download a 4GB update. Because of the clogged network, it took over 12 hours to download the update. Both the original version and the updated version of the OS clogged the network."
"It's difficult to give a full review of this product. Why? Because the automatic installation of Windows 10 that Dell put on the machine is awful. It installed unknown processes that have totally clogged my network bandwidth. It doesn't matter if I use wireless or wired, these processes are consuming all of my bandwidth so, not only is this computer's performance awful, but it effects every other device on the network. I spent almost 2 hours on the phone with Dell technical support (in India) and they could not find a fix. They have elevated the support ticket to higher level engineers who will contact me in 3 day. I'll come back to this site with an update."
"Dell are you serious?? A top end processor and 16 RAM and then you put your cheap wireless card 1707 that only does 2.4mhz and not 5 and works terrible! I put my lenova yoga 700 right beside the dell computer and the difference was shocking!! The lenova yoga was blazing along and the Dell inspiron was actually losing connection at times. Why Dell would you make a top end computer and put in a wireless card that might as well be from the 90's. I am taking the computer back to Costco. I can't stand companies that make such terrible decisions as the one made here. If you only plug the computer in via Ethernet then you should be fine. If you intend to run wirelessly then don't buy this computer!"
"I liked this machine until it started having problems 3 days after its one year warranty expired. Sound card problems (which magically disappeared), touchscreen went crazy as though someone were touching rapidly all over the screen (disabled feature), wireless mouse feature began doing same as touchscreen soon after. More than mildly irritating. Will take some real incentive pricing for me to purchase Dell again."
"I was definitely disappointed as I have used consumer reports for years to pick out electronics and this one fell short. I am not tech savvy, and maybe that is the problem, but this computer has run slow since day one, takes an extremely long time to start, and now will not download apps from windows :(. Set up was easy, but using it is very frustrating."
"It was a gift. It is very slow. you have no drive access. I would be ashamed to know I put something like this on the market for consumer!!!!!"
"I expected blazing speed and smooth flowing performance-doesn't happen. System is sluggish with cumbersome, hidden menus/sub-menus. Endless searching for even the most mundane and frequently used functions. It's choked with a huge amount of unwanted, unnecessary apps or teasers/lead-ins to apps/software. System randomly blanks out on desired web page. System appears to save browsing data even after it indicates that browsing history has been deleted. Some browsing history acquired on one day may not show up in browsing history until a day or more later leading you to believe that the browsing history has been deleted when it has not been. Apparent vs real control of browsing history is very deceptive especially using Bing web browser. HP wireless \"chicklets\"keyboard function is sketchy. Many keystrokes are missed causing delays due to need to erase and back-up to add missed letter stroke. HP wireless mouse connectivity/action is erratic and \"jumps around\" uncontrollably. Mouse cursor \"trail\" can not keep up with movement action of clicker even after increasing tracking speed."
"The hard drive failed after only 2 years. My Dell lasted for 10. There are better choices out there."
"cant down load anything from disk"
"If it crashes one more time I'm going to take it back to the shop it came from. The keyboard I've already taken back and been told it's been replaced, but still has the same problems."
